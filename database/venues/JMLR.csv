S.; Precup, Doina; Pineau, Joelle",,,Practical Kernel-Based Reinforcement Learning,JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,"Kernel-based reinforcement learning (KBRL) stands out among approximate reinforcement learning algorithms for its strong theoretical guarantees. By casting the learning problem as a local kernel approximation, KBRL provides a way of computing a decision policy which converges to a unique solution and is statistically consistent. Unfortunately, the model constructed by KBRL grows with the number of sample transitions, resulting in a computational cost that precludes its application to large-scale or on-line domains. In this paper we introduce an algorithm that turns KBRL into a practical reinforcement learning tool. Kernel-based stochastic factorization (KBSF) builds on a simple idea: when a transition probability matrix is represented as the product of two stochastic matrices, one can swap the factors of the multiplication to obtain another transition matrix, potentially much smaller than the original, which retains some fundamental properties of its precursor. KBSF exploits such an insight to compress the information contained in KBRL's model into an approximator of fixed size. This makes it possible to build an approximation considering both the difficulty of the problem and the associated computational cost. KBSF's computational complexity is linear in the number of sample transitions, which is the best one can do without discarding data. Moreover, the algorithm's simple mechanics allow for a fully incremental implementation that makes the amount of memory used independent of the number of sample transitions. The result is a kernel-based reinforcement learning algorithm that can be applied to large-scale problems in both off-line and on-line regimes. We derive upper bounds for the distance between the value functions computed by KBRL and KBSF using the same data. We also prove that it is possible to control the magnitude of the variables appearing in our bounds, which means that, given enough computational resources, we can make KBSF's value function as close as desired to the value function that would be computed by KBRL using the same set of sample transitions. The potential of our algorithm is demonstrated in an extensive empirical study in which KBSF is applied to difficult tasks based on real-world data. Not only does KBSF solve problems that had never been solved before, but it also significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms on the tasks studied.",,,,,"Barreto, André M S/J-5063-2013","Salguero Tejada, Carlos/0000-0003-0930-9277",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2016,17,,,,,,,,67,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000391522700001,0

Graph-based SFA (GSFA) is an extension to SFA for supervised learning that can be used to successfully solve regression problems if combined with a simple supervised post-processing step on a small number of slow features. The objective function of GSFA minimizes the squared output differences between pairs of samples specified by the edges of a structure called training graph. The edges of current training graphs, however, are derived only from the relative order of the labels. Exploiting the exact numerical value of the labels enables further improvements in label estimation accuracy. In this article, we propose the exact label learning (ELL) method to create a more precise training graph that encodes the desired labels explicitly and allows GSFA to extract a normalized version of them directly (i.e., without supervised post-processing). The ELL method is used for three tasks: (1) We estimate gender from artificial images of human faces (regression) and show the advantage of coding additional labels, particularly skin color. (2) We analyze two existing graphs for regression. (3) We extract compact discriminative features to classify traffic sign images. When the number of output features is limited, such compact features provide a higher classification rate compared to a graph that generates features equivalent to those of nonlinear Fisher discriminant analysis. The method is versatile, directly supports multiple labels, and provides higher accuracy compared to current graphs for the problems considered.",,,,,"Wiskott, Laurenz/P-7715-2017","Wiskott, Laurenz/0000-0001-6237-740X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2016,17,,,,,,,,157,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000391666600001,0

Such structures are also prevalent in block modeling of networks. In this paper, we develop a theory for the estimation and completion of matrices with biclustering structures, where the data is a partially observed and noise contaminated matrix with a certain underlying biclustering structure. In particular, we show that a constrained least squares estimator achieves minimax rate-optimal performance in several of the most important scenarios. To this end, we derive unified high probability upper bounds for all sub-Gaussian data and also provide matching minimax lower bounds in both Gaussian and binary cases. Due to the close connection of graphon to stochastic block models, an immediate consequence of our general results is a minimax rate-optimal estimator for sparse graphons.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2016,17,,,,,,,,161,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000391668000001,0

Many of the results are based on a general technique for obtaining bounds on the error rates of sample-consistent classifiers with monotonic error regions, in the realizable case. We prove bounds of this type expressed in terms of either the VC dimension or the sample compression size. This general technique also enables us to derive several new bounds on the error rates of general sample-consistent learning algorithms, as well as re fined bounds on the label complexity of the CAL active learning algorithm. Additionally, we establish a simple necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a distribution-free bound on the error rates of all sample-consistent learning rules, converging at a rate inversely proportional to the sample size. We also study learning in the presence of classification noise, deriving a new excess error rate guarantee for general VC classes under Tsybakov's noise condition, and establishing a simple and general necessary and sufficient condition for the minimax excess risk under bounded noise to converge at a rate inversely proportional to the sample size.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2016,17,,,,,,,,135,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000391658200001,0

This paper describes a domain-general data analysis method called CrossCat. CrossCat infers multiple non-overlapping views of the data, each consisting of a subset of the variables, and uses a separate nonparametric mixture to model each view. CrossCat is based on approximately Bayesian inference in a hierarchical, nonparametric model for data tables. This model consists of a Dirichlet process mixture over the columns of a data table in which each mixture component is itself an independent Dirichlet process mixture over the rows; the inner mixture components are simple parametric models whose form depends on the types of data in the table. CrossCat combines strengths of mixture modeling and Bayesian network structure learning. Like mixture modeling, CrossCat can model a broad class of distributions by positing latent variables, and produces representations that can be efficiently conditioned and sampled from for prediction. Like Bayesian networks, CrossCat represents the dependencies and independencies between variables, and thus remains accurate when there are multiple statistical signals. Inference is done via a scalable Gibbs sampling scheme; this paper shows that it works well in practice. This paper also includes empirical results on heterogeneous tabular data of up to 10 million cells, such as hospital cost and quality measures, voting records, unemployment rates, gene expression measurements, and images of handwritten digits. CrossCat infers structure that is consistent with accepted findings and common-sense knowledge in multiple domains and yields predictive accuracy competitive with generative, discriminative, and model-free alternatives.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2016,17,,,,,,,,138,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000391659400001,0

The methods draw samples from an appropriate distribution of partial orders on the nodes, continued by sampling directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) conditionally on the sampled partial orders. We show that the computations needed for the sampling algorithms are feasible as long as the encountered partial orders have relatively few down-sets. While the algorithms assume suitable modularity properties of the priors, arbitrary priors can be handled by dividing the importance weight of each sampled DAG by the number of topological sorts it has| we give a practical dynamic programming algorithm to compute these numbers. Our empirical results demonstrate that the presented partial-order-based samplers are superior to previous Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, which sample DAGs either directly or via linear orders on the nodes. The results also suggest that the convergence rate of the estimators based on AIS are competitive to those of MC3.

Objects are built by part-subpart compositions and expressed in terms of a hierarchical dictionary of object parts. These parts are represented on lattices of decreasing sizes which yield an executive summary description. We describe inference and learning algorithms for these models. We analyze the complexity of this model in terms of computation time (for serial computers) and numbers of nodes (e.g., neurons) for parallel computers. In particular, we compute the complexity gains by part sharing and its dependence on how the dictionary scales with the level of the hierarchy. We explore three regimes of scaling behavior where the dictionary size (i) increases exponentially with the level, (ii) is determined by an unsupervised compositional learning algorithm applied to real data, (iii) decreases exponentially with scale. This analysis shows that in some regimes the use of shared parts enables algorithms which can perform inference in time linear in the number of levels for an exponential number of objects.

The results reveal a number of surprising facts. In particular, under the noise model of Tsybakov (2004), the minimax label complexity of active learning with a VC class is always asymptotically smaller than that of passive learning, and is typically significantly smaller than the best previously-published upper bounds in the active learning literature. In high noise regimes, it turns out that all active learning problems of a given VC dimension have roughly the same minimax label complexity, which contrasts with well-known results for bounded noise. In low-noise regimes, we find that the label complexity is well-characterized by a simple combinatorial complexity measure we call the star number. Interestingly, we find that almost all of the complexity measures previously explored in the active learning literature have worst-case values exactly equal to the star number.

The method allows us to explore the range of operational costs associated with the set of reasonable statistical models, so as to provide a useful way for practitioners to understand uncertainty. To do this, the operational cost is cast as a regularization term in a learning algorithm's objective function, allowing either an optimistic or pessimistic view of possible costs, depending on the regularization parameter. From another perspective, if we have prior knowledge about the operational cost, for instance that it should be low, this knowledge can help to restrict the hypothesis space, and can help with generalization.

J,"Do, TMT; Artieres, T",,,,"Trinh-Minh-Tri Do; Artieres, Thierry",,,Regularized Bundle Methods for Convex and Non-Convex Risks,JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,"Machine learning is most often cast as an optimization problem. Ideally, one expects a convex objective function to rely on efficient convex optimizers with nice guarantees such as no local optima. Yet, non-convexity is very frequent in practice and it may sometimes be inappropriate to look for convexity at any price. Alternatively one can decide not to limit a priori the modeling expressivity to models whose learning may be solved by convex optimization and rely on non-convex optimization algorithms. The main motivation of this work is to provide efficient and scalable algorithms for non-convex optimization. We focus on regularized unconstrained optimization problems which cover a large number of modern machine learning problems such as logistic regression, conditional random fields, large margin estimation, etc. We propose a novel algorithm for minimizing a regularized objective that is able to handle convex and non-convex, smooth and non-smooth risks. The algorithm is based on the cutting plane technique and on the idea of exploiting the regularization term in the objective function. It may be thought as a limited memory extension of convex regularized bundle methods for dealing with convex and non convex risks.

We extract the parts of the signs that are present in most occurrences of the sign in context and are robust to the variations produced by adjacent signs. Each sentence video is first transformed into a multidimensional time series representation, capturing the motion and shape aspects of the sign. Skin color blobs are extracted from frames of color video sequences, and a probabilistic relational distribution is formed for each frame using the contour and edge pixels from the skin blobs. Each sentence is represented as a trajectory in a low dimensional space called the space of relational distributions. Given these time series trajectories, we extract signemes from multiple sentences concurrently using iterated conditional modes (ICM). We show results by learning single signs from a collection of sentences with one common pervading sign, multiple signs from a collection of sentences with more than one common sign, and single signs from a mixed collection of sentences.

Our primary contribution is in establishing finite sample risk bounds for prediction with the ubiquitous Principal Component Regression (PCR) method, under the factor regression model, with the number of principal components adaptively selected from the data-a form of theoretical guarantee that is surprisingly lacking from the PCR literature. To accomplish this, we prove a master theorem that establishes a risk bound for a large class of predictors, including the PCR predictor as a special case. This approach has the benefit of providing a unified framework for the analysis of a wide range of linear prediction methods, under the factor regression setting. In particular, we use our main theorem to recover known risk bounds for the minimum-norm interpolating predictor, which has received renewed attention in the past two years, and a prediction method tailored to a subclass of factor regression models with identifiable parameters. This model-tailored method can be interpreted as prediction via clusters with latent centers. To address the problem of selecting among a set of candidate predictors, we analyze a simple model selection procedure based on data-splitting, providing an oracle inequality under the factor model to prove that the performance of the selected predictor is close to the optimal candidate.

Considerable attention in recent years has been devoted to analyzing and modeling signed graphs, where the affinity measure between nodes takes either positive or negative values. Recently, Cucuringu et al. (2019) proposed a spectral method, namely SPONGE (Signed Positive over Negative Generalized Eigenproblem), which casts the clustering task as a generalized eigenvalue problem optimizing a suitably defined objective function. This approach is motivated by social balance theory, where the clustering task aims to decompose a given network into disjoint groups, such that individuals within the same group are connected by as many positive edges as possible, while individuals from different groups are mainly connected by negative edges. Through extensive numerical experiments, SPONGE was shown to achieve state-of-the-art empirical performance. On the theoretical front, Cucuringu et al. (2019) analyzed SPONGE, as well as the popular Signed Laplacian based spectral method under the setting of a Signed Stochastic Block Model, for k = 2 equal-sized clusters, in the regime where the graph is moderately dense. In this work, we build on the results in Cucuringu et al. (2019) on two fronts for the normalized versions of SPONGE and the Signed Laplacian. Firstly, for both algorithms, we extend the theoretical analysis in Cucuringu et al. (2019) to the general setting of k >= 2 unequal-sized clusters in the moderately dense regime. Secondly, we introduce regularized versions of both methods to handle sparse graphs - a regime where standard spectral methods are known to underperform - and provide theoretical guarantees under the same setting of a Signed Stochastic Block Model. To the best of our knowledge, regularized spectral methods have so far not been considered in the setting of clustering signed graphs.

Recent work has shown that mixed integer programming (MIP) can be used to solve (to optimality) l(0)-regularized regression problems at scales much larger than what was conventionally considered possible. Despite their usefulness, MIP-based global optimization approaches are significantly slower than the relatively mature algorithms for l(1)-regularization and heuristics for nonconvex regularized problems. We aim to bridge this gap in computation times by developing new MIP-based algorithms for l(0)-regularized classification. We propose two classes of scalable algorithms: an exact algorithm that can handle p approximate to 50, 000 features in a few minutes, and approximate algorithms that can address instances with p approximate to 10(6) in times comparable to the fast l(1)-based algorithms. Our exact algorithm is based on the novel idea of integrality generation, which solves the original problem (with p binary variables) via a sequence of mixed integer programs that involve a small number of binary variables. Our approximate algorithms are based on coordinate descent and local combinatorial search. In addition, we present new estimation error bounds for a class of l(0)-regularized estimators.

Most research on this problem has been focusing on projection methods like power iterations, such that this category of algorithms can achieve both optimal convergence rates and cheap per-iteration costs. In contrast, search methods belonging to another main category are less understood in this respect. In this work, we consider the leading eigenvector computation as a non-convex optimization problem on the (generalized) Stiefel manifold and covers the cases for both standard and generalized eigenvectors. It is shown that the inexact Riemannian gradient method induced by the shift-and-invert preconditioning is guaranteed to converge to one of the ground-truth eigenvectors at an optimal rate, e.g., O(root kappa(B) lambda(1)/lambda(1)-lambda(p+1) log 1/epsilon) for a pair of real symmetric matrices (A, B) with B being positive definite, where A represents the i-th largest generalized eigenvalue of the matrix pair, p is the multiplicity of lambda(1) , and kappa(B) stands for the condition number of B. The standard eigenvector computation is recovered by setting B to an identity matrix.

The output of GaBP is a set of approximate univariate marginals for each variable in the pairwise MG. An extension of GaBP (labeled GaBP-m), allowing for the approximation of higher-dimensional marginal distributions, was explored by Kamper et al. (2019). The idea is to create an MG in which each node is allowed to receive more than one variable. As in the univariate case, the multivariate extension does not necessarily converge in loopy graphs and, even if convergence occurs, is not guaranteed to provide exact inference. To address the problem of convergence, we consider a multivariate extension of the principle of node regularization proposed by Kamper et al. (2018). We label this algorithm slow GaBP-m (sGaBP-m), where the term slow relates to the damping effect of the regularization on the message passing. We prove that, given sufficient regularization, this algorithm will converge and provide the exact marginal means at convergence, regardless of the way variables are assigned to nodes. The selection of the degree of regularization is addressed through the use of a heuristic, which is based on a tree representation of sGaBP-m.

By generalizing across different inputs, information learned for one input can be immediately reused for improving predictions for another input. Reusing information allows an agent to compute an optimal decision-making strategy using less data. State representation is a key element of the generalization process, compressing a high-dimensional input space into a low-dimensional latent state space. This article analyzes properties of different latent state spaces, leading to new connections between model-based and model-free reinforcement learning. Successor features, which predict frequencies of future observations, form a link between model-based and model-free learning: Learning to predict future expected reward outcomes, a key characteristic of model-based agents, is equivalent to learning successor features. Learning successor features is a form of temporal difference learning and is equivalent to learning to predict a single policy's utility, which is a characteristic of model-free agents. Drawing on the connection between model-based reinforcement learning and successor features, we demonstrate that representations that are predictive of future reward outcomes generalize across variations in both transitions and rewards.

Under the bidding model, we further show our algorithms achieve a revenue convergence rate that matches the offline sample complexity of the single-item single-buyer auction. We also show regret bounds that are scale free, and match the offline sample complexity, when comparing to a benchmark that requires a lower bound on the market share.

Importantly, the computational cost of our estimator is only 2.Lasso(n, p), where Lasso(n, p) represents the computational burden of one Lasso optimization in a model of size (n, p). In comparison, existing grid search based approaches to this problem require a computational cost of at least n.Lasso(n, p) optimizations. Additionally, the proposed method is shown to be able to consistently detect the case of 'no change', i.e., where no finite change point exists in the model. We allow the true change point parameter tau(0) to possibly move to the boundaries of its parametric space, and the jump size parallel to beta(0) - gamma(0)parallel to(2) to possibly diverge as n increases. We then characterize the corresponding effects on the rates of convergence of the change point and regression estimates. In particular, we show that, while an increasing jump size may have a beneficial effect on the change point estimate, however the optimal rate of regression parameter estimates are preserved only upto a certain rate of the increasing jump size. This behavior in the rate of regression parameter estimates is unique to high dimensional change point regression models only.

In an overcomplete representation, the number of latent features exceeds the data dimensionality, which is useful when the data is undersampled by the measurements (compressed sensing or information bottlenecks in neural systems) or composed from multiple complete sets of linear features, each spanning the data space. Independent Components Analysis (ICA) is a linear technique for learning sparse latent representations, which typically has a lower computational cost than sparse coding, a linear generative model which requires an iterative, nonlinear inference step. While well suited for finding complete representations, we show that overcompleteness poses a challenge to existing ICA algorithms. Specifically, the coherence control used in existing ICA and other dictionary learning algorithms, necessary to prevent the formation of duplicate dictionary features, is ill-suited in the overcomplete case. We show that in the overcomplete case, several existing ICA algorithms have undesirable global minima that maximize coherence. We provide a theoretical explanation of these failures and, based on the theory, propose improved coherence control costs for overcomplete ICA algorithms. Further, by comparing ICA algorithms to the computationally more expensive sparse coding on synthetic data, we show that the limited applicability of overcomplete, linear inference can be extended with the proposed cost functions. Finally, when trained on natural images, we show that the coherence control biases the exploration of the data manifold, sometimes yielding suboptimal, coherent solutions.

We are interested in the role of depth - why do DNNs perform better than shallow models? - and the interpretation of DNNs- what do intermediate layers do? Despite the rapid development in their application, DNNs remain analytically unexplained because the hidden layers are nested and the parameters are not faithful. Inspired by the integral representation of shallow NNs, which is the continuum limit of the width, or the hidden unit number, we developed the flow representation and transport analysis of DNNs. The flow representation is the continuum limit of the depth, or the hidden layer number, and it is specified by an ordinary differential equation ( ODE) with a vector field. We interpret an ordinary DNN as a transport map or an Euler broken line approximation of the flow. Technically speaking, a dynamical system is a natural model for the nested feature maps. In addition, it opens a new way to the coordinate-free treatment of DNNs by avoiding the redundant parametrization of DNNs. Following Wasserstein geometry, we analyze a flow in three aspects: dynamical system, continuity equation, and Wasserstein gradient flow. A key finding is that we specified a series of transport maps of the denoising autoencoder (DAE), which is a cornerstone for the development of deep learning. Starting from the shallow DAE, this paper develops three topics: the transport map of the deep DAE, the equivalence between the stacked DAE and the composition of DAEs, and the development of the double continuum limit or the integral representation of the flow representation. As partial answers to the research questions, we found that deeper DAEs converge faster and the extracted features are better; in addition, a deep Gaussian DAE transports mass to decrease the Shannon entropy of the data distribution.

By deriving a simple formula for the effect of infinitesimal model perturbations on MFVB posterior means, we provide both improved covariance estimates and local robustness measures for MFVB, thus greatly expanding the practical usefulness of MFVB posterior approximations. The estimates for MFVB posterior covariances rely on a result from the classical Bayesian robustness literature that relates derivatives of posterior expectations to posterior covariances and includes the Laplace approximation as a special case. Our key condition is that the MFVB approximation provides good estimates of a select subset of posterior means-an assumption that has been shown to hold in many practical settings.

This identification can be accomplished by analyzing the constraints imposed by the latents in the measurements. We introduce the concept of pairwise cluster comparison (PCC) to identify causal relationships from clusters of data points and provide a two-stage algorithm called learning PCC (LPCC) that learns a latent variable model (LVM) using PCC. First, LPCC learns exogenous latents and latent colliders, as well as their observed descendants, by using pairwise comparisons between data clusters in the measurement space that may explain latent causes. Since in this first stage LPCC cannot distinguish endogenous latent non-colliders from their exogenous ancestors, a second stage is needed to extract the former, with their observed children, from the latter. If the true graph has no serial connections, LPCC returns the true graph, and if the true graph has a serial connection, LPCC returns a pattern of the true graph. LPCC's most important advantage is that it is not limited to linear or latent-tree models and makes only mild assumptions about the distribution. The paper is divided in two parts: Part I (this paper) provides the necessary preliminaries, theoretical foundation to PCC, and an overview of LPCC; Part II formally introduces the LPCC algorithm and experimentally evaluates its merit in different synthetic and real domains.

These problems require an acquisition function that can be separated into the contributions of the individual function evaluations. We develop one such acquisition function and call it Predictive Entropy Search with Constraints (PESC).

We take a bounded rationality approach and develop a partial update for PESC which trades off accuracy against speed. We then propose a method for adaptively switching between the partial and full updates for PESC. This allows us to interpolate between versions of PESC that are efficient in terms of function evaluations and those that are efficient in terms of wall-clock time.

Then, rather than solving the LS problem using the full data (X,Y), sketching algorithms solve the LS problem using only the sketched data (SX, SY). Prior work has typically adopted an algorithmic perspective, in that it has made no statistical assumptions on the input X and Y, and instead it has been assumed that the data (X,Y) are fixed and worst-case (WC). Prior results show that, when using sketching matrices such as random projections and leverage-score sampling algorithms, with p less than or similar to r << n the WC error is the same as solving the original problem, up to a small constant. From a statistical perspective, we typically consider the mean-squared error performance of randomized sketching algorithms, when data (X, Y) are generated according to a statistical model Y = X beta + epsilon, where epsilon is a noise process. We provide a rigorous comparison of both perspectives leading to insights on how they differ. To do this, we first develop a framework for assessing algorithmic and statistical aspects of randomized sketching methods.

But we must, with probability 1, start and then continue to predict upper bounds after a finite time irrespective of which p is an element of P governs the data. If it is possible, without knowledge of p and for any prescribed confidence however close to 1, to come up with a sequence of upper bounds that is never violated over an infinite time window with confidence at least as big as prescribed, we say the model class P is insurable.

Since the computation required for feature extraction dominates the test-time cost of a classifier in these settings, we develop two algorithms to efficiently balance the performance with the test-time cost. Our first contribution describes how to construct and optimize a tree of classifiers, through which test inputs traverse along individual paths. Each path extracts different features and is optimized for a specific sub-partition of the input space. Our second contribution is a natural reduction of the tree of classifiers into a cascade. The cascade is particularly useful for class-imbalanced data sets as the majority of instances can be early-exited out of the cascade when the algorithm is sufficiently confident in its prediction.

We consider two instances of this problem: unsupervised aggregation where no information about a target ranking is available, and supervised aggregation where ground truth preferences are provided. For each problem class we develop novel learning methods that are applicable to a wide range of preference types.(1) Specifically, for unsupervised aggregation we introduce the Multinomial Preference model (MPM) which uses a multinomial generative process to model the observed preferences. For the supervised problem we develop a supervised extension for MPM and then propose two fully supervised models. The first model employs SVD factorization to derive effective item features, transforming the aggregation problems into a learning-to-rank one. The second model aims to eliminate the costly SVD factorization and instantiates a probabilistic CRF framework, deriving unary and pairwise potentials directly from the observed preferences. Using a probabilistic framework allows us to directly optimize the expectation of any target metric, such as NDCG or ERR.

In our distributed algorithms the data is partitioned across separate processors and inference is done in a parallel, distributed fashion. We propose two distributed algorithms for LDA. The first algorithm is a straightforward mapping of LDA to a distributed processor setting. In this algorithm processors concurrently perform Gibbs sampling over local data followed by a global update of topic counts. The algorithm is simple to implement and can be viewed as an approximation to Gibbs-sampled LDA. The second version is a model that uses a hierarchical Bayesian extension of LDA to directly account for distributed data. This model has a theoretical guarantee of convergence but is more complex to implement than the first algorithm. Our distributed algorithm for HDP takes the straightforward mapping approach, and merges newly-created topics either by matching or by topic-id. Using five real-world text corpora we show that distributed learning works well in practice. For both LDA and HDP, we show that the converged test-data log probability for distributed learning is indistinguishable from that obtained with single-processor learning.

This problem generates a vast search space to be explored, well suited for stochastic optimization techniques. FMS can be applied to any classification domain as it does not require domain knowledge. Different model types and a variety of algorithms can be considered under this formulation. Furthermore, competitive yet simple models can be obtained with FMS. We adopt PSO for the search because of its proven performance in different problems and because of its simplicity, since neither expensive computations nor complicated operations are needed. Interestingly, the way the search is guided allows PSO to avoid overfitting to some extend. Experimental results on benchmark data sets give evidence that the proposed approach is very effective, despite its simplicity.

In this paper we give a simple generic reduction that, given an algorithm for the external regret problem, converts it to an efficient online algorithm for the internal regret problem. We provide methods that work both in the full information model, in which the loss of every action is observed at each time step, and the partial information ( bandit) model, where at each time step only the loss of the selected action is observed. The importance of internal regret in game theory is due to the fact that in a general game, if each player has sublinear internal regret, then the empirical frequencies converge to a correlated equilibrium. For external regret we also derive a quantitative regret bound for a very general setting of regret, which includes an arbitrary set of modification rules ( that possibly modify the online algorithm) and an arbitrary set of time selection functions ( each giving different weight to each time step).

It is applicable to arbitrary factor graphs, provided that the size of the Markov blankets is not too large. It consists of two steps: (i) an approximate inference method, for example, belief propagation, is used to approximate cavity distributions for each variable (i. e., probability distributions on the Markov blanket of a variable for a modified graphical model in which the factors involving that variable have been removed); (ii) all cavity distributions are improved by a message-passing algorithm that cancels out approximation errors by imposing certain consistency constraints. This loop correction (LC) method usually gives significantly better results than the original, uncorrected, approximate inference algorithm that is used to estimate the effect of loops. Indeed, we often observe that the loop-corrected error is approximately the square of the error of the uncorrected approximate inference method.

This simple theory predicts that the scaling exponents alpha approximate to 4/d for cross-entropy and mean-squared error losses.

While convolutional layers map between high-order activation tensors, the fully connected layers operate on flattened activation vectors. Despite empirical success, this approach has notable drawbacks. Flattening followed by fully connected layers discards multilinear structure in the activations and requires many parameters. We address these problems by incorporating tensor algebraic operations that preserve multilinear structure at every layer. First, we introduce Tensor Contraction Layers (TCLs) that reduce the dimensionality of their input while preserving their multilinear structure using tensor contraction. Next, we introduce Tensor Regression Layers (TRLs), which express outputs through a low-rank multilinear mapping from a high-order activation tensor to an output tensor of arbitrary order. We learn the contraction and regression factors end-to-end, and produce accurate nets with fewer parameters. Additionally, our layers regularize networks by imposing low-rank constraints on the activations (TCL) and regression weights (TRL). Experiments on ImageNet show that, applied to VGG and ResNet architectures, TCLs and TRLs reduce the number of parameters compared to fully connected layers by more than 65% while maintaining or increasing accuracy. In addition to the space savings, our approach's ability to leverage topological structure can be crucial for structured data such as MRI.

If f(x) is the loss function, and C is the constraint set in a constrained minimization problem, then the proximal distance principle mandates minimizing the penalized loss f (x) + rho/2 dist(x, C)(2) and following the solution x(rho) to its limit as rho tends to infinity. At each iteration the squared Euclidean distance dist(x,C)(2) is majorized by the spherical quadratic parallel to x-P-c(x(k))parallel to(2), where P-c(x(k)) denotes the projection of the current iterate x(k) onto C. The minimum of the surrogate function f (x) + rho/2 parallel to x-P-c(x(k))parallel to(2) is given by the proximal map prox(rho-1) (f)[P-c(x(k))]. The next iterate x(k+1) automatically decreases the original penalized loss for fixed rho. Since many explicit projections and proximal maps are known, it is straightforward to derive and implement novel optimization algorithms in this setting. These algorithms can take hundreds if not thousands of iterations to converge, but the simple nature of each iteration makes proximal distance algorithms competitive with traditional algorithms. For convex problems, proximal distance algorithms reduce to proximal gradient algorithms and therefore enjoy well understood convergence properties. For nonconvex problems, one can attack convergence by invoking Zangwill's theorem. Our numerical examples demonstrate the utility of proximal distance algorithms in various high-dimensional settings, including a) linear programming, b) constrained least squares, c) projection to the closest kinship matrix, d) projection onto a second-order cone constraint, e) calculation of Horn's copositive matrix index, f) linear complementarity programming, and g) sparse principal components analysis.

This includes nonconvex variants of lasso, sparse group lasso, tree-structured lasso, nuclear norm and total variation regularizers. We propose to move the nonconvexity from the regularizer to the loss.

Learning with the convexified regularizer can be performed by existing efficient algorithms originally designed for convex regularizers (such as the proximal algorithm, Frank-Wolfe algorithm, alternating direction method of multipliers and stochastic gradient descent). This is further extended to consider cases where the convexified regularizer does not have a closed-form proximal step, and when the loss function is nonconvex nonsmooth.

Differentially privacy, which uses a more rigorous definition of privacy loss, has shown more success in sanitizing continuous data. However, both syntactic and differential privacy are susceptible to inference attacks, i.e., an adversary can accurately infer sensitive attributes from sanitized data. The paper proposes a novel filter-based mechanism which preserves privacy of continuous and high-dimensional attributes against inference attacks. Finding the optimal utility-privacy tradeoff is formulated as a min-diff-max optimization problem. The paper provides an ERM-like analysis of the generalization error and also a practical algorithm to perform minimax optimization.

Advantages of the method over purely noisy mechanisms is explained and demonstrated with examples.

J,"Qiu, Q; Sapiro, G",,,,"Qiu, Qiang; Sapiro, Guillermo",,,Learning Transformations for Clustering and Classification,JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,"A low-rank transformation learning framework for subspace clustering and classification is proposed here. Many high-dimensional data, such as face images and motion sequences, approximately lie in a union of low-dimensional subspaces. The corresponding subspace clustering problem has been extensively studied in the literature to partition such high-dimensional data into clusters corresponding to their underlying low-dimensional subspaces. Low-dimensional intrinsic structures are often violated for real-world observations, as they can be corrupted by errors or deviate from ideal models. We propose to address this by learning a linear transformation on subspaces using nuclear norm as the modeling and optimization criteria. The learned linear transformation restores a low-rank structure for data from the same subspace, and, at the same time, forces a maximally separated structure for data from different subspaces. In this way, we reduce variations within the subspaces, and increase separation between the subspaces for a more robust subspace clustering. This proposed learned robust subspace clustering framework significantly enhances the performance of existing subspace clustering methods. Basic theoretical results presented here help to further support the underlying framework. To exploit the low-rank structures of the transformed subspaces, we further introduce a fast subspace clustering technique, which efficiently combines robust PCA with sparse modeling. When class labels are present at the training stage, we show this low-rank transformation framework also significantly enhances classification performance. Extensive experiments using public data sets are presented, showing that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for subspace clustering and classification. The learned low cost transform is also applicable to other classification frameworks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,FEB,2015,16,,,,,,187,226,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000369885800002,0

We show that the recursive teaching dimension, recently introduced by Zilles et al.

To the best of our knowledge these are the first results unveiling such relations between teaching and query learning as well as between teaching and the VC-dimension. It will turn out that for many natural classes the RTD is upper-bounded by the VCD, e.g., classes of VCdimension 1, intersection-closed classes and finite maximum classes. However, we will also show that there are certain (but rare) classes for which the recursive teaching dimension exceeds the VC-dimension. Moreover, for maximum classes, the combinatorial structure induced by the RTD, called teaching plan, is highly similar to the structure of sample compression schemes. Indeed one can transform any repetition-free teaching plan for a maximum class C into an unlabeled sample compression scheme for C and vice versa, while the latter is produced by (i) the corner-peeling algorithm of Rubinstein and Rubinstein (2012) and (ii) the tail matching algorithm of Kuzmin and Warmuth (2007).",,,,,,"Simon, Hans/0000-0002-1587-0944",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,OCT,2014,15,,,,,,3107,3131,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000344638800009,0

In this paper, we propose three new methods for using decision trees to learn Markov network structures. The advantage of using decision trees is that they are very fast to learn and can represent complex interactions among many variables. The first method, DTSL, learns a decision tree to predict each variable and converts each tree into a set of conjunctive features that define the Markov network structure. The second, DT-BLM, builds on DTSL by using it to initialize a search-based Markov network learning algorithm recently proposed by DTSL with those learned by an L1-regularized logistic regression method (L1) proposed by Ravikumar et al. (2009). In an extensive empirical evaluation on 20 data sets, DTSL is comparable to L1 and significantly faster and more accurate than two other baselines. DT-BLM is slower than DTSL, but obtains slightly higher accuracy.

It is defined as the expected False Discovery Proportion (FDP), that is, the expected fraction of false positives among rejected hypotheses. When the hypotheses are independent, the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure achieves FDR control at any pre-specified level. By construction, FDR control offers no guarantee in terms of power, or type II error. A number of alternative procedures have been developed, including plug-in procedures that aim at gaining power by incorporating an estimate of the proportion of true null hypotheses. In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of a class of plug-in procedures based on kernel estimators of the density of the p-values, as the number m of tested hypotheses grows to infinity. In a setting where the hypotheses tested are independent, we prove that these procedures are asymptotically more powerful in two respects: (i) a tighter asymptotic FDR control for any target FDR level and (ii) a broader range of target levels yielding positive asymptotic power. We also show that this increased asymptotic power comes at the price of slower, non-parametric convergence rates for the FDP. These rates are of the form m(-k/(2k+1)), where k is determined by the regularity of the density of the p-value distribution, or, equivalently, of the test statistics distribution.

The algorithms are specializations of prior work on learning causal structures from overlapping variable sets. This problem has also been addressed in the field of statistical matching. The proposed methods are applied to a wide range of domains and are shown to accurately predict the presence of thousands of dependencies. Compared against prototypical statistical matching algorithms and within the scope of our experiments, the proposed algorithms make predictions that are better correlated with the sample estimates of the unknown parameters on test data; this is particularly the case when the number of commonly measured variables is low. The enabling idea behind the methods is to induce one or all causal models that are simultaneously consistent with (fit) all available data sets and prior knowledge and reason with them. This allows constraints stemming from causal assumptions (e.g., Causal Markov Condition, Faithfulness) to propagate. Several methods have been developed based on this idea, for which we propose the unifying name Integrative Causal Analysis (INCA). A contrived example is presented demonstrating the theoretical potential to develop more general methods for co-analyzing heterogeneous data sets.

This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efficient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a comparison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to configure neural networks and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks configured by a pure grid search, we find that random search over the same domain is able to find models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search finds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising configuration space. Compared with deep belief networks configured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional configuration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for configuring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent High Throughput methods achieve surprising success-they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural baseline against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,FEB,2012,13,,,,,,281,305,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000303046000003,0

The most influential work is the margin theory, which is essentially an upper bound for the generalization error of any voting classifier in terms of the margin distribution over the training data. However, important questions were raised about the margin explanation. Breiman (1999) proved a bound in terms of the minimum margin, which is sharper than the margin distribution bound. He argued that the minimum margin would be better in predicting the generalization error. Grove and Schuurmans (1998) developed an algorithm called LP-AdaBoost which maximizes the minimum margin while keeping all other factors the same as AdaBoost. In experiments however, LP-AdaBoost usually performs worse than AdaBoost, putting the margin explanation into serious doubt. In this paper, we make a refined analysis of the margin theory. We prove a bound in terms of a new margin measure called the Equilibrium margin (Emargin). The Emargin bound is uniformly sharper than Breiman's minimum margin bound. Thus our result suggests that the minimum margin may be not crucial for the generalization error. We also show that a large Emargin and a small empirical error at Emargin imply a smaller bound of the generalization error. Experimental results on benchmark data sets demonstrate that AdaBoost usually has a larger Emargin and a smaller test error than LP-AdaBoost, which agrees well with our theory.",,,,,"Sugiyama, Masashi/AEO-1176-2022","Sugiyama, Masashi/0000-0001-6658-6743",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,JUN,2011,12,,,,,,1835,1863,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000293757200002,0

In this paper, we show that for a class of linear structural equation models with correlated errors, there is a local Markov property which will invoke only a linear number of conditional independence relations. For general linear models, we provide a local Markov property that often invokes far fewer conditional independencies than that in Richardson (2003).

In this paper we propose the minimal nonlinear distortion (MND) principle for tackling the ill-posedness of nonlinear ICA problems. MND prefers the nonlinear ICA solution with the estimated mixing procedure as close as possible to linear, among all possible solutions. It also helps to avoid local optima in the solutions. To achieve MND, we exploit a regularization term to minimize the mean square error between the nonlinear mixing mapping and the best-fitting linear one. The effect of MND on the inherent trivial and non-trivial indeterminacies in nonlinear ICA solutions is investigated. Moreover, we show that local MND is closely related to the smoothness regularizer penalizing large curvature, which provides another useful regularization condition for nonlinear ICA. Experiments on synthetic data show the usefulness of the MND principle for separating various nonlinear mixtures. Finally, as an application, we use nonlinear ICA with MND to separate daily returns of a set of stocks in Hong Kong, and the linear causal relations among them are successfully discovered. The resulting causal relations give some interesting insights into the stock market. Such a result can not be achieved by linear ICA. Simulation studies also verify that when doing causality discovery, sometimes one should not ignore the nonlinear distortion in the data generation procedure, even if it is weak.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,NOV,2008,9,,,,,,2455,2487,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000262637600002,0

J,"Zhao, P; Yu, B",,,,"Zhao, Peng; Yu, Bin",,,Stagewise Lasso,JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,"Many statistical machine learning algorithms minimize either an empirical loss function as in Ad-aBoost, or a penalized empirical loss as in Lasso or SVM. A single regularization tuning parameter controls the trade-off between fidelity to the data and generalizability, or equivalently between bias and variance. When this tuning parameter changes, a regularization path of solutions to the minimization problem is generated, and the whole path is needed to select a tuning parameter to optimize the prediction or interpretation performance. Algorithms such as homotopy-Lasso or LARS-Lasso and Forward Stagewise Fitting (FSF) (aka e-Boosting) are of great interest because of their resulted sparse models for interpretation in addition to prediction. In this paper, we propose the BLasso algorithm that ties the FSF (e-Boosting) algorithm with the Lasso method that minimizes the L-1 penalized L-2 loss. BLasso is derived as a coordinate descent method with a fixed stepsize applied to the general Lasso loss function (L1 penalized convex loss). It consists of both a forward step and a backward step. The forward step is similar to e-Boosting or FSF, but the backward step is new and revises the FSF (or e-Boosting) path to approximate the Lasso path. In the cases of a finite number of base learners and a bounded Hessian of the loss function, the BLasso path is shown to converge to the Lasso path when the stepsize goes to zero. For cases with a larger number of base learners than the sample size and when the true model is sparse, our simulations indicate that the BLasso model estimates are sparser than those from FSF with comparable or slightly better prediction performance, and that the the discrete stepsize of BLasso and FSF has an additional regularization effect in terms of prediction and sparsity. Moreover, we introduce the Generalized BLasso algorithm to minimize a general convex loss penalized by a general convex function. Since the (Generalized) BLasso relies only on differences not derivatives, we conclude that it provides a class of simple and easy-to-implement algorithms for tracing the regularization or solution paths of penalized minimization problems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,DEC,2007,8,,,,,,2701,2726,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000252745100002,0

The average reward optimality criterion has been recognized to be more appropriate for a wide class of continuing tasks than the discounted framework. Although average reward RL has been studied for decades, prior work has been largely limited to flat policy representations. In this paper, we develop a framework for HRL based on the average reward optimality criterion. We investigate two formulations of HRL based on the average reward SMDP model, both for discrete-time and continuous-time. These formulations correspond to two notions of optimality that have been previously explored in HRL: hierarchical optimality and recursive optimality. We present algorithms that learn to find hierarchically and recursively optimal average reward policies under discrete-time and continuous-time average reward SMDP models. We use two automated guided vehicle (AGV) scheduling tasks as experimental testbeds to study the empirical performance of the proposed algorithms. The first problem is a relatively simple AGV scheduling task, in which the hierarchically and recursively optimal policies are different. We compare the proposed algorithms with three other HRL methods, including a hierarchically optimal discounted reward algorithm and a recursively optimal discounted reward algorithm on this problem. The second problem is a larger AGV scheduling task. We model this problem using both discrete-time and continuous-time models. We use a hierarchical task decomposition in which the hierarchically and recursively optimal policies are the same for this problem.

In other cases, as in computer vision, a norm or variance normalization step, where all feature vectors are normalized to a common length, is generally used. These representations and pre-processing step map the original data from R p to the surface of a hypersphere Sp-1. Such representations should then be modeled using spherical distributions. However, the difficulty associated with such spherical representations has prompted researchers to model their spherical data using Gaussian distributions instead-as if the data were represented in R p rather than Sp-1. This opens the question to whether the classification results calculated with the Gaussian approximation are the same as those obtained when using the original spherical distributions. In this paper, we show that in some particular cases ( which we named spherical-homoscedastic) the answer to this question is positive. In the more general case however, the answer is negative. For this reason, we further investigate the additional error added by the Gaussian modeling. We conclude that the more the data deviates from spherical-homoscedastic, the less advisable it is to employ the Gaussian approximation. We then show how our derivations can be used to define optimal classifiers for spherical-homoscedastic distributions. By using a kernel which maps the original space into one where the data adapts to the spherical-homoscedastic model, we can derive non-linear classifiers with potential applications in a large number of problems.

The method is based on designing sequential control variates using successive approximations of the function of interest V. Regular Monte Carlo estimates have a variance of O(1/N), where N is the number of sample trajectories of the Markov chain. Here, we obtain a geometric variance reduction O(rho(N)) (with rho < 1) up to a threshold that depends on the approximation error V - AV, where A is an approximation operator linear in the values. Thus, if V belongs to the right approximation space (i.e. AV = V), the variance decreases geometrically to zero. An immediate application is value function estimation in Markov chains, which may be used for policy evaluation in a policy iteration algorithm for solving Markov Decision Processes. Another important domain, for which variance reduction is highly needed, is gradient estimation, that is computing the sensitivity partial derivative alpha V of the performance measure V with respect to some parameter a of the transition probabilities. For example, in policy parametric optimization, computing an estimate of the policy gradient is required to perform a gradient optimization method. We show that, using two approximations for the value function and the gradient, a geometric variance reduction is also achieved, up to a threshold that depends on the approximation errors of both of those representations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,FEB,2006,7,,,,,,413,427,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000236331700008,0

Such algorithms can often handle large-scale problems that may be difficult for systematic search algorithms. Nevertheless, the computational cost of solving such problems is still very high. We observed that many of the repair steps applied by such algorithms are redundant in the sense that they do not eventually contribute to finding a solution. Such redundant steps are particularly harmful in repair-based search, where each step carries high cost due to the very high branching factor typically associated with it. Accurately identifying and avoiding such redundant steps would result in faster local search without harming the algorithm's problem-solving ability. In this paper we propose a speed-up learning methodology for attaining this goal. It consists of the following steps: defining the concept of a redundant step; acquiring this concept during off-line learning by analyzing solution paths for training problems, tagging all the steps along the paths according to the redundancy definition and using an induction algorithm to infer a classifier based on the tagged examples; and using the acquired classifier to filter out redundant steps while solving unseen problems.

Unfortunately, standard Monte Carlo sampling methods can exhibit slow convergence, and more sophisticated quasi-Monte Carlo methods have not yet been applied to the space of permutations. To address this, we investigate new approaches based on two classes of approximation methods and compare them empirically. First, we demonstrate quadrature techniques in a RKHS containing functions of permutations, using the Mallows kernel in combination with kernel herding and sequential Bayesian quadrature. The RKHS perspective also leads to quasi-Monte Carlo type error bounds, with a tractable discrepancy measure defined on permutations.

While the traditional approach to statistical learning theory typically relies on standard assumptions from probability theory (e.g., i.i.d. or stationary ergodic), in this work we are interested in developing a theory of learning based only on the most fundamental and necessary assumptions implicit in the requirements of the learning problem itself. We specifically study universally consistent function learning, where the objective is to obtain low long-run average loss for any target function, when the data follow a given stochastic process. We are then interested in the question of whether there exist learning rules guaranteed to be universally consistent given only the assumption that universally consistent learning is possible for the given data process. The reasoning that motivates this criterion emanates from a kind of optimist's decision theory, and so we refer to such learning rules as being optimistically universal. We study this question in three natural learning settings: inductive, self-adaptive, and online. Remarkably, as our strongest positive result, we find that optimistically universal learning rules do indeed exist in the self-adaptive learning setting. Establishing this fact requires us to develop new approaches to the design of learning algorithms. Along the way, we also identify concise characterizations of the family of processes under which universally consistent learning is possible in the inductive and self-adaptive settings.

Going Beyond Bias-Variance via ANOVA,JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,"Modern machine learning methods are often overparametrized, allowing adaptation to the data at a fine level. This can seem puzzling; in the worst case, such models do not need to generalize. This puzzle inspired a great amount of work, arguing when overparametrization reduces test error, in a phenomenon called double descent. Recent work aimed to under-stand in greater depth why overparametrization is helpful for generalization. This lead to discovering the unimodality of variance as a function of the level of parametrization, and to decomposing the variance into that arising from label noise, initialization, and randomness in the training data to understand the sources of the error. In this work we develop a deeper understanding of this area. Specifically, we propose using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) to decompose the variance in the test error in a symmetric way, for studying the generalization performance of certain two-layer linear and non-linear networks. The advantage of the analysis of variance is that it reveals the effects of initialization, label noise, and training data more clearly than prior approaches. Moreover, we also study the monotonicity and unimodality of the variance components. While prior work studied the unimodality of the overall variance, we study the properties of each term in the variance decomposition. One of our key insights is that often, the interaction between training samples and initialization can dominate the variance; surprisingly being larger than their marginal effect. Also, we characterize phase transitions where the variance changes from unimodal to monotone. On a technical level, we leverage advanced deterministic equivalent techniques for Haar random matrices, that-to our knowledge-have not yet been used in the area.

Nevertheless, scenarios with input noise are common in real problems, as measurements are never perfectly accurate.

In this paper, we focus on multi-class classification problems and use Gaussian processes (GPs) as the underlying classifier. Motivated by a data set coming from the astrophysics domain, we hypothesize that the observed data may contain noise in the inputs. Therefore, we devise several multi-class GP classifiers that can account for input noise. Such classifiers can be efficiently trained using variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution of the latent variables of the model. Moreover, in some situations, the amount of noise can be known before-hand. If this is the case, it can be readily introduced in the proposed methods. This prior information is expected to lead to better performance results. We have evaluated the proposed methods by carrying out several experiments, involving synthetic and real data. These include several data sets from the UCI repository, the MNIST data set and a data set coming from astrophysics.

By integrating all available data sources, we seek to discover common group structure among the samples that may be hidden in individualistic cluster analyses of a single data view. While several techniques for such integrative clustering have been explored, we propose and develop a convex formalization that enjoys strong empirical performance and inherits the mathematical properties of increasingly popular convex clustering methods. Specifically, our Integrative Generalized Convex Clustering Optimization (iGecco) method employs different convex distances, losses, or divergences for each of the different data views with a joint convex fusion penalty that leads to common groups. Additionally, integrating mixed multi-view data is often challenging when each data source is high-dimensional. To perform feature selection in such scenarios, we develop an adaptive shifted grouplasso penalty that selects features by shrinking them towards their loss-specific centers. Our so-called iGecco+ approach selects features from each data view that are best for determining the groups, often leading to improved integrative clustering. To solve our problem, we develop a new type of generalized multi-block ADMM algorithm using subproblem approximations that more efficiently fits our model for big data sets.

The goal of precision medicine is to identify the optimal treatment regime (OTR) that yields the most favorable clinical outcome. Prior to adopting any OTR in clinical practice, it is crucial to know the impact of implementing such a policy. Although considerable research has been devoted to estimating the OTR in the literature, less attention has been paid to statistical inference of the OTR. Challenges arise in the nonregular cases where the OTR is not uniquely defined. To deal with nonregularity, we develop a novel inference method for the mean outcome under an OTR (the optimal value function) based on subsample aggregating (subagging). The proposed method can be applied to multi-stage studies where treatments are sequentially assigned over time. Bootstrap aggregating (bagging) and subagging have been recognized as effective variance reduction techniques to improve unstable estimators or classifiers (Buhlmann and Yu, 2002). However, it remains unknown whether these approaches can yield valid inference results. We show the proposed confidence interval (CI) for the optimal value function achieves nominal coverage. In addition, due to the variance reduction effect of subagging, our method enjoys certain statistical optimality. Specifically, we show that the mean squared error of the proposed value estimator is strictly smaller than that based on the simple sample-splitting estimator in the nonregular cases. Moreover, under certain conditions, the length of our proposed CI is shown to be on average shorter than CIs constructed based on the existing state-of-the-art method (Luedtke and van der Laan, 2016) and the oracle method which works as well as if an OTR were known.

In this paper, we propose a novel estimator for statistical inference on edge parameters in pairwise graphical models based on generalized Hyvarinen scoring rule. Hyvarinen scoring rule is especially useful in cases where the normalizing constant cannot be obtained efficiently in a closed form, which is a common problem for graphical models, including Ising models and truncated Gaussian graphical models.

However, in many practical applications such as collaborative fi ltering and network analysis, we only get a partial observation. Under such scenarios, we consider the fundamental problem of recovering spectral properties of the underlying matrix from a sampling of its entries. In this paper, we address the problem of directly recovering the spectrum, which is the set of singular values, and also in sample-e ffi cient approaches for recovering a spectral sum function, which is an aggregate sum of a fi xed function applied to each of the singular values. Our approach is to fi rst estimate the Schatten k -norms of a matrix for a small set of values of k, and then apply Chebyshev approximation when estimating a spectral sum function or apply moment matching in Wasserstein distance when estimating the singular values directly. The main technical challenge is in accurately estimating the Schatten norms from a sampling of a matrix.

We establish that such subgraphs can be recovered from the solution of a particular semidefinite relaxation with high probability if the input graph is sampled from a distribution of clusterable graphs. Specifically, the semidefinite relaxation is exact if the graph consists of k large disjoint subgraphs, corresponding to clusters, with weight concentrated within these subgraphs, plus a moderate number of nodes not belonging to any cluster. Further, we establish that if noise is weakly obscuring these clusters, i.e, the between-cluster edges are assigned very small weights, then we can recover significantly smaller clusters. For example, we show that in approximately sparse graphs, where the between-cluster weights tend to zero as the size n of the graph tends to infinity, we can recover clusters of size polylogarithmic in n under certain conditions on the distribution of edge weights.

In this paper, we propose a novel two-layer feature reduction method (TLFre) for SGL via a decomposition of its dual feasible set. The two-layer reduction is able to quickly identify the inactive groups and the inactive features, respectively, which are guaranteed to be absent from the sparse representation and can be removed from the optimization. Existing feature reduction methods are only applicable to sparse models with one sparsity-inducing regularizer. To our best knowledge, TLFre is the first one that is capable of dealing with multiple sparsity-inducing regularizers. Moreover, TLFre has a very low computational cost and can be integrated with any existing solvers. We also develop a screening method-called DPC (decomposition of convex set)-for non-negative Lasso.

Our approach mitigates the impact of outliers by hedging against a family of probability distributions on the observed data, some of which assign very low probabilities to the outliers. The set of distributions under consideration are close to the empirical distribution in the sense of the Wasserstein metric. We show that this DRO formulation can be relaxed to a convex optimization problem which encompasses a class of models. By selecting proper norm spaces for the Wasserstein metric, we are able to recover several commonly used regularized regression models. We provide new insights into the regularization term and give guidance on the selection of the regularization coefficient from the standpoint of a confidence region. We establish two types of performance guarantees for the solution to our formulation under mild conditions. One is related to its out-of-sample behavior (prediction bias), and the other concerns the discrepancy between the estimated and true regression planes (estimation bias). Extensive numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our approach to a host of regression models, in terms of the prediction and estimation accuracies.

In many cases an identifiability algorithm may return a complicated expression that contains variables that are in fact unnecessary.

Prior research has quantified the effects of classical sketch on the strictly simpler least squares regression (LSR) problem. We establish that classical sketch has a similar effect upon the optimization properties of MRR as it does on those of LSR: namely, it recovers nearly optimal solutions. By contrast, Hessian sketch does not have this guarantee; instead, the approximation error is governed by a subtle interplay between the mass in the responses and the optimal objective value. For both types of approximation, the regularization in the sketched MRR problem results in significantly different statistical properties from those of the sketched LSR problem. In particular, there is a bias-variance trade-off in sketched MRR that is not present in sketched LSR. We provide upper and lower bounds on the bias and variance of sketched MRR; these bounds show that classical sketch significantly increases the variance, while Hessian sketch significantly increases the bias. Empirically, sketched MRR solutions can have risks that are higher by an order-of-magnitude than those of the optimal MRR solutions. We establish theoretically and empirically that model averaging greatly decreases the gap between the risks of the true and sketched solutions to the MRR problem.

However, practical implementations of kernel regression or classification consist of quantizing or sub-sampling data for improving time efficiency, often at the cost of prediction quality. While such tradeoffs are necessary in practice, their statistical implications are generally not well understood, hence practical implementations come with few performance guarantees. In particular, it is unclear whether it is possible to maintain the statistical accuracy of kernel prediction-crucial in some applications-while improving prediction time. The present work provides guiding principles for combining kernel prediction with data-quantization so as to guarantee good tradeoffs between prediction time and accuracy, and in particular so as to approximately maintain the good accuracy of vanilla kernel prediction. Furthermore, our tradeoff guarantees are worked out explicitly in terms of a tuning parameter which acts as a knob that favors either time or accuracy depending on practical needs. On one end of the knob, prediction time is of the same order as that of single-nearest-neighbor prediction which is statistically inconsistent) while maintaining consistency; on the other end of the knob, the prediction risk is nearly minimax-optimal in terms of the original data size) while still reducing time complexity. The analysis thus reveals the interaction between the data-quantization approach and the kernel prediction method, and most importantly gives explicit control of the tradeoff to the practitioner rather than fixing the tradeoff in advance or leaving it opaque. The theoretical results are validated on data from a range of real-world application domains; in particular we demonstrate that the theoretical knob performs as expected.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2017,18,,,,,,,,44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000405963500001,0

The second approach proposed, with runtime in O(klog(k)) (although in practice both perform similarly), uses a novel null space projection method, which extracts information from a sequence of p-norms to estimate the maximum value in the vector (this is equivalent to querying a small number of moments from a distribution of bounded support in order to estimate the maximum).

Identifying PICO elements in the full-texts of trial reports is thus a critical yet time-consuming step in the systematic review process. We seek to expedite evidence synthesis by developing machine learning models to automatically extract sentences from articles relevant to PICO elements. Collecting a large corpus of training data for this task would be prohibitively expensive. Therefore, we derive distant supervision (DS) with which to train models using previously conducted reviews. DS entails heuristically deriving 'soft' labels from an available structured resource. However, we have access only to unstructured, free-text summaries of PICO elements for corresponding articles; we must derive from these the desired sentence-level annotations.To this end, we propose a novel method {supervised distant supervision (SDS) - {that uses a small amount of direct supervision to better exploit a large corpus of distantly labeled instances by learning to pseudo-annotate articles using the available DS.

In contrast to recent methods which accelerate the learning problem by restricting the search space, our main contribution is a fast algorithm for score-based structure learning which does not restrict the search space in any way and works on high-dimensional data sets with thousands of variables. Our use of concave regularization, as opposed to the more popular l(0) (e.g. BIC) penalty, is new. Moreover, we provide theoretical guarantees which generalize existing asymptotic results when the underlying distribution is Gaussian. Most notably, our framework does not require the existence of a so-called faithful DAG representation, and as a result, the theory must handle the inherent nonidentifiability of the estimation problem in a novel way. Finally, as a matter of independent interest, we provide a comprehensive comparison of our approach to several standard structure learning methods using open-source packages developed for the R language. Based on these experiments, we show that our algorithm obtains higher sensitivity with comparable false discovery rates for high-dimensional data and scales efficiently as the number of nodes increases.

The pursuit of fast rates in online and statistical learning has led to the discovery of many conditions in learning theory under which fast learning is possible. We show that most of these conditions are special cases of a single, unifying condition, that comes in two forms: the central condition for 'proper' learning algorithms that always output a hypothesis in the given model, and stochastic mixability for online algorithms that may make predictions outside of the model. We show that under surprisingly weak assumptions both conditions are, in a certain sense, equivalent. The central condition has a re-interpretation in terms of convexity of a set of pseudoprobabilities, linking it to density estimation under misspecification. For bounded losses, we show how the central condition enables a direct proof of fast rates and we prove its equivalence to the Bernstein condition, itself a generalization of the Tsybakov margin condition, both of which have played a central role in obtaining fast rates in statistical learning. Yet, while the Bernstein condition is two-sided, the central condition is one-sided, making it more suitable to deal with unbounded losses. In its stochastic mixability form, our condition generalizes both a stochastic exp-concavity condition identified by Juditsky, Rigollet and Tsybakov and Vovk's notion of mixability. Our unifying conditions thus provide a substantial step towards a characterization of fast rates in statistical learning, similar to how classical mixability characterizes constant regret in the sequential prediction with expert advice setting.",,,,,,"Mehta, Nishant/0000-0002-9639-0124",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,SEP,2015,16,,,,,,1793,1861,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000369887300005,0

Computationally, obtaining an exact global optimizer is rather challenging. To overcome the difficulty, we use an alternating directions method solving a low-rank subproblem and a sparseness subproblem alternatively, where we derive an exact solution to the low-rank subproblem, as well as an exact solution in a special case and an approximated solution generally through a surrogate of the Lo-constraint and difference convex programming, for the sparse subproblem. Theoretically, we establish convergence rates of a global minimizer in the Hellinger-distance, providing an insight into why pursuit of two different types of decomposed structures is expected to deliver higher estimation accuracy than its counterparts based on either sparseness alone or low-rank approximation alone.

To allow model misspeci fi cation, our upper bound results are obtained in a framework of aggregation of estimates. A striking feature is that no speci fi c relationship among the predictors is needed to achieve the upper rates of convergence (hence permitting basically arbitrary correlations between the predictors). Therefore, whatever the true regression function (assumed to be uniformly bounded), our estimators automatically exploit any sparse representation of the regression function (if any), to the best extent possible within the l(q)-constrained linear combinations for any 0 <= q <= 1. A sparse approximation result in the l(q)-hulls turns out to be crucial to adaptively achieve minimax rate optimal aggregation.

The proposed algorithm i) clusters a given collection of HMMs into groups of HMMs that are similar, in terms of the distributions they represent, and ii) characterizes each group by a cluster center, that is, a novel HMM that is representative for the group, in a manner that is consistent with the underlying generative model of the HMM. To cope with intractable inference in the E-step, the HEM algorithm is formulated as a variational optimization problem, and efficiently solved for the HMM case by leveraging an appropriate variational approximation. The benefits of the proposed algorithm, which we call variational HEM (VHEM), are demonstrated on several tasks involving time-series data, such as hierarchical clustering of motion capture sequences, and automatic annotation and retrieval of music and of online hand-writing data, showing improvements over current methods. In particular, our variational HEM algorithm effectively leverages large amounts of data when learning annotation models by using an efficient hierarchical estimation procedure, which reduces learning times and memory requirements, while improving model robustness through better regularization.",,,,,"CHAN, Antoni B./D-7858-2013","CHAN, Antoni B./0000-0002-2886-2513",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,FEB,2014,15,,,,,,697,747,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000335457700011,0

These linear models have a long tradition and appear in seemingly unrelated regressions, structural equation modelling, and approaches to causal inference. They are also related to Gaussian graphical models via a classical representation known as a path diagram. Despite the models' long history, a number of problems remain open. In this paper, we address the problem of computing maximum likelihood estimates in the subclass of 'bow-free' recursive linear models. The term 'bow-free' refers to the condition that the errors for variables i and j be uncorrelated if variable i occurs in the structural equation for variable j. We introduce a new algorithm, termed Residual Iterative Conditional Fitting (RICF), that can be implemented using only least squares computations.

Given a weighted directed acyclic graph whose edge weights can change in an arbitrary (adversarial) way, a decision maker has to choose in each round of a game a path between two distinguished vertices such that the loss of the chosen path ( defined as the sum of the weights of its composing edges) be as small as possible. In a setting generalizing the multi-armed bandit problem, after choosing a path, the decision maker learns only the weights of those edges that belong to the chosen path. For this problem, an algorithm is given whose average cumulative loss in n rounds exceeds that of the best path, matched off-line to the entire sequence of the edge weights, by a quantity that is proportional to 1/root n and depends only polynomially on the number of edges of the graph. The algorithm can be implemented with complexity that is linear in the number of rounds n (i.e., the average complexity per round is constant) and in the number of edges. An extension to the so-called label efficient setting is also given, in which the decision maker is informed about the weights of the edges corresponding to the chosen path at a total of m << n time instances. Another extension is shown where the decision maker competes against a time-varying path, a generalization of the problem of tracking the best expert. A version of the multi-armed bandit setting for shortest path is also discussed where the decision maker learns only the total weight of the chosen path but not the weights of the individual edges on the path.

The combination is realized for generative models with discrete latents by using truncated posteriors as the family of variational distributions. The variational parameters of truncated posteriors are sets of latent states. By interpreting these states as genomes of individuals and by using the variational lower bound to define a fitness, we can apply evolutionary algorithms to realize the variational loop. The used variational distributions are very flexible and we show that evolutionary algorithms can effectively and efficiently optimize the variational bound. Furthermore, the variational loop is generally applicable (black box) with no analytical derivations required. To show general applicability, we apply the approach to three generative models (we use Noisy-OR Bayes Nets, Binary Sparse Coding, and Spike-and-Slab Sparse Coding). To demonstrate effectiveness and efficiency of the novel variational approach, we use the standard competitive benchmarks of image denoising and inpainting. The benchmarks allow quantitative comparisons to a wide range of methods including probabilistic approaches, deep deterministic and generative networks, and non-local image processing methods. In the category of zero-shot learning (when only the corrupted image is used for training), we observed the evolutionary variational algorithm to significantly improve the state-of-the-art in many benchmark settings.

J,"Arachie, C; Huang, B",,,,"Arachie, Chidubem; Huang, Bert",,,A General Framework for Adversarial Label Learning,JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,We consider the task of training classifiers without fully labeled data. We propose a weakly supervised method-adversarial label learning-that trains classifiers to perform well when noisy and possibly correlated labels are provided. Our framework allows users to provide different weak labels and multiple constraints on these labels. Our model then attempts to learn parameters for the data by solving a zero-sum game for the binary problems and a non-zero sum game optimization for multi-class problems. The game is between an adversary that chooses labels for the data and a model that minimizes the error made by the adversarial labels. The weak supervision constrains what labels the adversary can choose. The method therefore minimizes an upper bound of the classifier's error rate using projected primal-dual subgradient descent.

The algorithm combines both gradient-descent and Newton-like behaviors as well as inertia. We prove the convergence of INNA for most deep learning problems. To do so, we provide a well-suited framework to analyze deep learning loss functions involving tame optimization in which we study a continuous dynamical system together with its discrete stochastic approximations.

Our HTE method first implements a histogram transformed partition to the random affine mapped data, then adaptively leverages constant functions or SVMs to obtain the individual regression estimates, and eventually builds the ensemble predictor through an average strategy. First of all, in this paper, we investigate the theoretical properties of HTE when the regression function lies in the Holder space C-k,C-alpha, k is an element of N-0, alpha is an element of (0, 1]. In the case that k = 0, 1, we adopt the constant regressors and develop the naive his-togram transforms (NHT). Within the space C-0,C-alpha although almost optimal convergence rates can be derived for both single and ensemble NHT, we fail to show the benefits of ensembles over single estimators theoretically. In contrast, in the subspace C-1,C-alpha, we prove that if d >= 2(1 + alpha)/alpha, the lower bound of the convergence rates for single NHT turns out to be worse than the upper bound of the convergence rates for ensemble NHT. In the other case when k >= 2, the NHT may no longer be appropriate in predicting smoother regression functions. Instead, we circumvent this issue by applying kernel histogram transforms (KHT) equipped with smoother regressors, such as support vector machines (SVMs). Accordingly, it turns out that both single and ensemble KHT enjoy almost optimal convergence rates. Then, we validate the above theoretical results with extensive numerical experiments. On the one hand, simulations are conducted to elucidate that ensemble NHT outperforms single NHT. On the other hand, the effects of bin sizes on the accuracy of both NHT and KHT are also in accord with the theoretical analysis. Last but not least, in the real-data experiments, comparisons between the ensemble KHT, equipped with adaptive histogram transforms, and other state-of-the-art large-scale regression estimators verify the effectiveness and precision of the proposed algorithm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2021,22,,,,,,,,95,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000663148600001,0

The SOEC objective and constraints contain expectations defined with respect to complex distributions or large data sets, leading to high computational complexity when solved by the algorithms that use exact functions and their gradients. Recent stochastic first order methods exhibit low computational complexity when handling SOECs but guarantee near-feasibility and near-optimality only at convergence. These methods may thus return highly infeasible solutions when heuristically terminated, as is often the case, due to theoretical convergence criteria being highly conservative. This issue limits the use of first order methods in several applications where the SOEC constraints encode implementation requirements. We design a stochastic feasible level set method (SFLS) for SOECs that has low complexity and emphasizes feasibility before convergence. Specifically, our level-set method solves a root-finding problem by calling a novel first order oracle that computes a stochastic upper bound on the level-set function by extending mirror descent and online validation techniques.

Besides, most of the traditional co-training approaches are implemented for two-view cases, and their extensions in multi-view scenarios are not intuitive.

However, in the large-scale setting, empirical risk minimization may be computationally restrictive. In this paper, we design an efficient algorithm to approximate the population risk minimizer in generalized linear problems such as binary classification with surrogate losses and generalized linear regression models. We focus on large-scale problems where the iterative minimization of the empirical risk is computationally intractable, i.e., the number of observations n is much larger than the dimension of the parameter p (n >> p >> 1). We show that under random sub-Gaussian design, the true minimizer of the population risk is approximately proportional to the corresponding ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator. Using this relation, we design an algorithm that achieves the same accuracy as the empirical risk minimizer through iterations that attain up to a quadratic convergence rate, and that are computationally cheaper than any batch optimization algorithm by at least a factor of O (p). We provide theoretical guarantees for our algorithm, and analyze the convergence behavior in terms of data dimensions. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on well-known classification and regression problems, through extensive numerical studies on large-scale datasets, and show that it achieves the highest performance compared to several other widely used optimization algorithms.",,,,,,"Bayati, Mohsen/0000-0002-7280-912X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2019,20,,,,,,,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000458663200001,0

Typically, the observation vector for decentralized decision making is represented by a concatenation of the (local) information an agent gathers about other agents. However, concatenation scales poorly to swarm systems with a large number of homogeneous agents as it does not exploit the fundamental properties inherent to these systems: (i) the agents in the swarm are interchangeable and (ii) the exact number of agents in the swarm is irrelevant. Therefore, we propose a new state representation for deep multi-agent RL based on mean embeddings of distributions, where we treat the agents as samples and use the empirical mean embedding as input for a decentralized policy. We define different feature spaces of the mean embedding using histograms, radial basis functions and neural networks trained end-to-end. We evaluate the representation on two well-known problems from the swarm literature - rendezvous and pursuit evasion in a globally and locally observable setup.

Typical applications include many popular statistical machine learning methods such as elastic-net regression, ridge penalized logistic regression, and sparse additive regression. Existing optimization literature has shown that for strongly convex minimization, the CBCD-type methods attain iteration complexity of O(p log(1/epsilon)), where E is a pre-specified accuracy of the objective value, and p is the number of blocks. However, such iteration complexity explicitly depends on p, and therefore is at least p times worse than the complexity O(log(1/epsilon)) of gradient descent (GD) methods. To bridge this theoretical gap, we propose an improved convergence analysis for the CBCD-type methods. In particular, we first show that for a family of quadratic minimization problems, the iteration complexity O(log(2) (p).log(1/epsilon)) of the CBCD-type methods matches that of the GD methods in term of dependency on p, up to a log(2)p factor. Thus our complexity bounds are sharper than the existing bounds by at least a factor of p/log(2)(p). We also provide a lower bound to confirm that our improved complexity bounds are tight (up to a log(2)(p) factor), under the assumption that the largest and smallest eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix do not scale with p.

However, it is difficult to understand and interpret DT models in ultrahigh dimensions and DT models usually suffer from the curse of dimensionality and achieve degenerated performance when there are many noisy features. To address these issues, this paper first presents a novel data-dependent generalization error bound for the perceptron decision tree (PDT), which provides the theoretical justification to learn a sparse linear hyperplane in each decision node and to prune the tree. Following our analysis, we introduce the notion of budget-aware classifier (BAC) with a budget constraint on the weight coefficients, and propose a supervised budgeted tree (SBT) algorithm to achieve non-linear prediction performance. To avoid generating an unstable and complicated decision tree and improve the generalization of the SBT, we present a pruning strategy by learning classifiers to minimize cross-validation errors on each BAC. To deal with ultrahigh label dimensions, based on three important phenomena of real-world data sets from a variety of application domains, we develop a sparse coding tree framework for multi-label annotation problems and provide the theoretical analysis. Extensive empirical studies verify that 1) SBT is easy to understand and interpret in ultrahigh dimensions and is more resilient to noisy features. 2) Compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, our proposed sparse coding tree framework is more efficient, yet accurate in ultrahigh label and feature dimensions.",,,,,,"Tsang, Ivor/0000-0001-8095-4637",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2017,18,,,,,,,,81,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000412062300001,0

Based on the fundamental Neyman-Pearson Lemma, we used a plug-in approach to construct NP-type classifiers for Naive Bayes models. The proposed classifiers satisfy the NP oracle inequalities, which are natural NP paradigm counterparts of the oracle inequalities in classical binary classification.

However, most existing work is on networks that simply encode whether relationships exist or not. In contrast, relationships in signed networks can be positive (like, trust) or negative (dislike, distrust). The theory of social balance shows that signed networks tend to conform to some local patterns that, in turn, induce certain global characteristics. In this paper, we exploit both local as well as global aspects of social balance theory for two fundamental problems in the analysis of signed networks: sign prediction and clustering. Local patterns of social balance have been used in the past for sign prediction. We define more general measures of social imbalance (MOIs) based on l-cycles in the network and give a simple sign prediction rule. Interestingly, by examining measures of social imbalance, we show that the classic Katz measure, which is used widely in unsigned link prediction, also has a balance theoretic interpretation when applied to signed networks. Motivated by the global structure of balanced networks, we propose an effective low rank modeling approach for both sign prediction and clustering. We provide theoretical performance guarantees for our low-rank matrix completion approach via convex relaxations, scale it up to large problem sizes using a matrix factorization based algorithm, and provide extensive experimental validation including comparisons with local approaches. Our experimental results indicate that, by adopting a more global viewpoint of social balance, we get significant performance and computational gains in prediction and clustering tasks on signed networks. Our work therefore highlights the usefulness of the global aspect of balance theory for the analysis of signed networks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,MAR,2014,15,,,,,,1177,1213,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000335458100011,0

The dependency on the average error is important in problems with limited number of samples per iteration, for which the average of the errors can be significantly smaller in size than the supremum of the errors.

We choose l(p)-norms to provide a specific type of push; if the user sets p larger, the objective concentrates harder on the top of the list. We derive a generalization bound based on the p-norm objective, working around the natural asymmetry of the problem. We then derive a boosting- style algorithm for the problem of ranking with a push at the top. The usefulness of the algorithm is illustrated through experiments on repository data. We prove that the minimizer of the algorithm's objective is unique in a specific sense. Furthermore, we illustrate how our objective is related to quality measurements for information retrieval.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,OCT,2009,10,,,,,,2233,2271,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000272346400003,0

In the classification module we use support vector machines (SVMs)-here also other tool such as MLP or RBF can be used.

The NEUROSVM is tested on twelve benchmark data sets and the performance of the NEUROSVMis found to be better than both MLP and SVM. We also compare the performance of proposed architecture with that of two ensemble methods: majority voting and averaging. Here also the NEUROSVM is found to perform better than these two ensemble methods. Further we explore the use of MLP and RBF in the classification module of the proposed architecture. The most attractive feature of NEUROSVM is that it practically eliminates the severe dependency of SVM on the choice of kernel.

These problems have been traditionally solved using aggregation, but choosing the right level of aggregation requires resolving the classic tradeoff between aggregation error and sampling error. We propose a method that estimates the value of a resource at different levels of aggregation simultaneously, and then uses a weighted combination of the estimates.

Boosted classification trees are known to perform quite well for such problems. In this article we consider the use of standard, off-the-shelf boosting for two more general problems: 1) classification with unequal costs or, equivalently, classification at quantiles other than 1/2, and 2) estimation of the conditional class probability function P [ y = 1 vertical bar x]. We first examine whether the latter problem, estimation of P [ y = 1 vertical bar x], can be solved with Logit-Boost, and with AdaBoost when combined with a natural link function. The answer is negative: both approaches are often ineffective because they overfit P [ y = 1 vertical bar x] even though they perform well as classifiers. A major negative point of the present article is the disconnect between class probability estimation and classification. Next we consider the practice of over/under-sampling of the two classes. We present an algorithm that uses AdaBoost in conjunction with Over/Under-Sampling and Jittering of the data (JOUS-Boost). This algorithm is simple, yet successful, and it preserves the advantage of relative protection against overfitting, but for arbitrary misclassification costs and, equivalently, arbitrary quantile boundaries.

Like belief propagation, VMP proceeds by sending messages between nodes in the network and updating posterior beliefs using local operations at each node. Each such update increases a lower bound on the log evidence ( unless already at a local maximum). In contrast to belief propagation, VMP can be applied to a very general class of conjugate-exponential models because it uses a factorised variational approximation. Furthermore, by introducing additional variational parameters, VMP can be applied to models containing non-conjugate distributions. The VMP framework also allows the lower bound to be evaluated, and this can be used both for model comparison and for detection of convergence.

Such rich model classes may be too complex to admit uniformly consistent estimators. In such cases, it is conventional to settle for estimators with guarantees on convergence rate where the performance can be bounded in a model-dependent way, i.e. pointwise consistent estimators. But this viewpoint has the practical drawback that estimator performance is a function of the unknown model within the model class that is being estimated. Even if an estimator is consistent, how well it is doing at any given time may not be clear, no matter what the sample size of the observations. In these cases, a line of analysis favors sample dependent guarantees. We explore this framework by studying rich model classes that may only admit pointwise consistency guarantees, yet enough information about the unknown model driving the observations needed to gauge estimator accuracy can be inferred from the sample at hand. In this paper we obtain a novel characterization of lossless compression problems over a countable alphabet in the data-derived framework in terms of what we term deceptive distributions. We also show that the ability to estimate the redundancy of compressing memoryless sources is equivalent to learning the underlying single-letter marginal in a data-derived fashion.

Practically, Proto-NN is simpler to implement and enjoys reduced computational complexity. We then proceed to study convergence rates of the excess error probability. We first obtain rates for the standard k-NN rule under a margin condition and a new generalized Lipschitz condition. The latter is an extension of a recently proposed modified-Lipschitz condition from Rd to metric spaces. Similarly to the modified-Lipschitz condition, the new condition avoids any boundness assumptions on the data distribution. While obtaining rates for Proto-NN is left open, we show that a second prototype rule that hybridizes between k-NN and Proto-NN achieves the same rates as k-NN while enjoying similar computational advantages as Proto-NN.

These systems are governed by interaction laws, which are often unknown: estimating them from observation data is a fundamental task that can provide meaningful insights and accurate predictions of the behaviour of the agents. In this paper, we consider the inverse problem of learning interaction laws given data from multiple trajectories, in a nonparametric fashion, when the interaction kernels depend on pairwise distances. We establish a condition for learnability of interaction kernels, and construct an estimator based on the minimization of a suitably regularized least squares functional, that is guaranteed to converge, in a suitable L-2 space, at the optimal min-max rate for 1-dimensional nonparametric regression. We propose an efficient learning algorithm to construct such estimator, which can be implemented in parallel for multiple trajectories and is therefore well-suited for the high dimensional, big data regime. Numerical simulations on a variety examples, including opinion dynamics, predator-prey and swarm dynamics and heterogeneous particle dynamics, suggest that the learnability condition is satisfied in models used in practice, and the rate of convergence of our estimator is consistent with the theory.

We provide a construction to show that suboptimal local minima (i.e., non-global ones), even though degenerate, exist for fully connected neural networks with sigmoid activation functions.

In the case of log loss, the bounds imply convergence rates for generalized Bayesian inference under misspecification in terms of a generalization of the Hellinger metric as long as the learning rate eta is set correctly. For general loss functions, our bounds rely on two separate conditions: the v -GRIP(generalized reversed information projection) conditions, which control the lower tail of the excess loss; and the newly introduced witness condition, which controls the upper tail. The parameter v in the v-GRIP conditions determines the achievable rate and is akin to the exponent in the Tsybakov margin condition and the Bernstein condition for bounded losses, which the v-GRIP conditions generalize; favorable v in combination with small model complexity leads to (O) over tilde (1/n) rates.

An intuitive global learning approach is first to find an essential graph over all variables representing all Markov equivalent causal networks, and then enumerate all equivalent networks and estimate a pair of the total and direct effects for each of them. However, it could be inefficient to learn an essential graph and enumerate equivalent networks when the true causal graph is large. In this paper, we propose a local learning approach instead. In the local learning approach, we first learn locally a chain component containing the treatment. Then, if necessary, we learn locally a chain component containing the response.

Thus, in the presence of noise, the effects of the delay become negligible after a few iterations and the algorithm converges at the same optimal rate as standard SGD.

For smooth nonconvex functions, SNVRG converges to an 6-approximate first-order stationary point within O (n A 6-2 + 63 A n1/262)1 number of stochastic gradient evaluations.

Both MCBoost algorithms are defined with respect to a gamma - phi loss and can reduce to classical boosting procedures (such as AdaBoost and LogitBoost) for binary problems. Beyond the algorithms themselves, the proposed formulation enables a unified treatment of many previous multiclass boosting algorithms. This is used to show that the latter implement different combinations of optimization strategy, codewords, weak learners, and loss function, highlighting some of their deficiencies. It is shown that no previous method matches the support of MCBoost for real codewords of maximum capacity, a proper margin-enforcing loss function, and any family of multidimensional predictors and weak learners. Experimental results confirm the superiority of MCBoost, showing that the two proposed MCBoost algorithms outperform comparable prior methods on a number of datasets.",,,,,,"Vasconcelos, Nuno/0000-0002-9024-4302",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2019,20,,,,,,,,137,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000491132200001,0

Our suggested method is not only scalable but also performs simultaneous dimensionality reduction and variable selection. Under some mild regularity conditions, we show that SEED enjoys nice sampling properties including consistency in estimation, rank selection, prediction, and model selection.

A fundamental result says that the number of examples needed to learn an unknown target concept c is an element of C under an unknown distribution D, is tightly determined by the VC dimension d of the concept class C. Specifically, in the PAC model circle minus(d/epsilon + log(1/(delta)/epsilon) examples are necessary and sufficient for a learner to output, with probability 1 - delta, a hypothesis h that is epsilon-close to the target concept c (measured under D). In the related agnostic model, where the samples need not come from a c is an element of C, we know that circle minus(d/epsilon(2) + log(1/(delta)/epsilon(2)) examples are necessary and sufficient to output an hypothesis h epsilon C whose error is at most E worse than the error of the best concept in C. Here we analyze quantum sample complexity, where each example is a coherent quantum state. This model was introduced by Bshouty and Jackson (1999), who showed that quantum examples are more powerful than classical examples in some fixed-distribution settings. However, Atici and Servedio (2005), improved by Zhang (2010), showed that in the PAC setting (where the learner has to succeed for every distribution), quantum examples cannot be much more powerful: the required number of quantum examples is Omega(d(1-eta)/epsilon + d + log (1/(delta)/epsilon) for arbitrarily small constant eta > 0. Our main result is that quantum and classical sample complexity are in fact equal up to constant factors in both the PAC and agnostic models. We give two proof approaches. The first is a fairly simple information-theoretic argument that yields the above two classical bounds and yields the same bounds for quantum sample complexity up to a log(d/epsilon) factor. We then give a second approach that avoids the log-factor loss, based on analyzing the behavior of the Pretty Good Measurement on the quantum state-identification problems that correspond to learning. This shows classical and quantum sample complexity are equal up to constant factors for every concept class C.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2018,19,,,,,,,,71,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000452056200001,0

We generalize this result and we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the algorithm to approximate projections with a rate of 1/t.

Column subset selection has been applied to numerous real-world data applications such as population genetics summarization, electronic circuits testing and recommendation systems. In many applications the complete data matrix is unavailable and one needs to select representative columns by inspecting only a small portion of the input matrix. In this paper we propose the first provably correct column subset selection algorithms for partially observed data matrices. Our proposed algorithms exhibit different merits and limitations in terms of statistical accuracy, computational efficiency, sample complexity and sampling schemes, which provides a nice exploration of the tradeoff between these desired properties for column subset selection. The proposed methods employ the idea of feedback driven sampling and are inspired by several sampling schemes previously introduced for low-rank matrix approximation tasks (Drineas et al., 2008; Frieze et al., 2004; Deshpande and Vempala, 2006; Krishnamurthy and Singh, 2014). Our analysis shows that, under the assumption that the input data matrix has incoherent rows but possibly coherent columns, all algorithms provably converge to the best low-rank approximation of the original data as number of selected columns increases. Furthermore, two of the proposed algorithms enjoy a relative error bound, which is preferred for column subset selection and matrix approximation purposes.

In particular, we first show that RSG can reduce the dependence of SG's iteration complexity on the distance between the initial solution and the optimal set to that between the is an element of -level set and the optimal set multiplied by a logarithmic factor. Moreover, we show the advantages of RSG over SG in solving a broad family of problems that satisfy a local error bound condition, and also demonstrate its advantages for three specific families of convex optimization problems with different power constants in the local error bound condition. (a) For the problems whose epigraph is a polyhedron, RSG is shown to converge linearly.

To select features that have complex nonlinear relationships with the response variable, the dependence measure should be equitable, a concept proposed by Reshef et al. (2011); that is, the dependence measure treats linear and nonlinear relationships equally. Recently, Kinney and Atwal (2014) gave a mathematical definition of self-equitability. In this paper, we introduce a new concept of robust-equitability and identify a robust-equitable copula dependence measure, the robust copula dependence (RCD) measure. RCD is based on the L-1-distance of the copula density from uniform and we show that it is equitable under both equitability definitions. We also prove theoretically that RCD is much easier to estimate than mutual information. Because of these theoretical properties, the RCD measure has the following advantages compared to existing dependence measures: it is robust to different relationship forms and robust to unequal sample sizes of different features.

The multiscale decomposition yields a sequence of optimal transport problems, that are solved in a top-to-bottom fashion from the coarsest to the finest scale. We provide numerical evidence that this multiscale approach scales approximately linearly, in time and memory, in the number of nodes, instead of quadratically or worse for a direct solution.

In Part I, we showed that if the true graph has no serial connections, then LPCC returns the true graph, and if the true graph has a serial connection, then LPCC returns a pattern of the true graph. In this paper (Part II), we formally introduce the LPCC algorithm that implements the PCC concept. In addition, we thoroughly evaluate LPCC using simulated and real-world data sets in comparison to state-of-the-art algorithms. Besides using three real-world data sets, which have already been tested in learning an LVM, we also evaluate the algorithms using data sets that represent two original problems. The first problem is identifying young drivers' involvement in road accidents, and the second is identifying cellular subpopulations of the immune system from mass cytometry. The results of our evaluation show that LPCC improves in accuracy with the sample size, can learn large LVMs, and is accurate in learning compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.

We show that weighting each coordinate i according to an estimate of the variation of f along coordinate i -e.g. the L-1 norm of the ith-directional derivative of f -is an efficient way to significantly improve the performance of distance-based regressors such as kernel and kappa-NN regressors. The approach, termed Gradient Weighting (GW), consists of a first pass regression estimate f(n) which serves to evaluate the directional derivatives of f, and a second-pass regression estimate on the re-weighted data. The GW approach can be instantiated for both regression and classification, and is grounded in strong theoretical principles having to do with the way regression bias and variance are affected by a generic feature-weighting scheme. These theoretical principles provide further technical foundation for some existing feature-weighting heuristics that have proved successful in practice. We propose a simple estimator of these derivative norms and prove its consistency. The proposed estimator computes efficiently and easily extends to run online. We then derive a classification version of the GW approach which evaluates on real-worlds datasets with as much success as its regression counterpart.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2016,17,,,,,,,,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000391474400001,0

However, building useful risk stratification models presents many technical challenges including the large number of factors (both intrinsic and extrinsic) influencing a patient's risk of an adverse outcome and the inherent evolution of that risk over time. We address these challenges in the context of learning a risk stratification model for predicting which patients are at risk of acquiring a Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). We take a novel data-centric approach, leveraging the contents of EHRs from nearly 50,000 hospital admissions. We show how, by adapting techniques from multitask learning, we can learn models for patient risk stratification with unprecedented classification performance. Our model, based on thousands of variables, both time-varying and time-invariant, changes over the course of a patient admission. Applied to a held out set of approximately 25,000 patient admissions, we achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.81 (95% CI 0.78-0.84). The model has been integrated into the health record system at a large hospital in the US, and can be used to produce daily risk estimates for each inpatient.

Using a common hidden Markov model framework we build single-stream gesture models based on which we can generate multiple single stream-based hypotheses for an unknown gesture sequence.

Unfortunately, the development and application of LFMs can be inhibited by their computational cost, especially when closed-form solutions for the LFM are unavailable, as is the case in many real world problems where these latent forces exhibit periodic behaviour. Given this, we develop a new sparse representation of LFMs which considerably improves their computational efficiency, as well as broadening their applicability, in a principled way, to domains with periodic or near periodic latent forces. Our approach uses a linear basis model to approximate one generative model for each periodic force. We assume that the latent forces are generated from Gaussian process priors and develop a linear basis model which fully expresses these priors. We apply our approach to model the thermal dynamics of domestic buildings and show that it is effective at predicting day-ahead temperatures within the homes. We also apply our approach within queueing theory in which quasi-periodic arrival rates are modelled as latent forces. In both cases, we demonstrate that our approach can be implemented efficiently using state-space methods which encode the linear dynamic systems via LFMs. Further, we show that state estimates obtained using periodic latent force models can reduce the root mean squared error to 17% of that from non-periodic models and 27% of the nearest rival approach which is the resonator model (Sarkka et al., 2012; Hartikainen et al., 2012).",,,,,"Jennings, Nick/HGU-8308-2022","Jennings, Nick/0000-0003-0166-248X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,JUL,2014,15,,,,,,2337,2397,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000344638400001,0

For example, they are often used to explore complex systems where connections between entities are not well understood, such as in functional brain networks or genetic networks. Existing methods for estimating structure of undirected graphical models focus on scenarios where each node represents a scalar random variable, such as a binary neural activation state or a continuous mRNA abundance measurement, even though in many real world problems, nodes can represent multivariate variables with much richer meanings, such as whole images, text documents, or multi-view feature vectors. In this paper, we propose a new principled framework for estimating the structure of undirected graphical models from such multivariate (or multi-attribute) nodal data. The structure of a graph is inferred through estimation of non-zero partial canonical correlation between nodes. Under a Gaussian model, this strategy is equivalent to estimating conditional independencies between random vectors represented by the nodes and it generalizes the classical problem of covariance selection (Dempster, 1972). We relate the problem of estimating non-zero partial canonical correlations to maximizing a penalized Gaussian likelihood objective and develop a method that efficiently maximizes this objective. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the method under various conditions. We provide illustrative applications to uncovering gene regulatory networks from gene and protein pro files, and uncovering brain connectivity graph from positron emission tomography data.

This embedding represents any probability measure as a mean element in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). A pseudometric on the space of probability measures can be defined as the distance between distribution embeddings: we denote this as gamma(k), indexed by the kernel function k that defines the inner product in the RKHS. We present three theoretical properties of gamma(k). First, we consider the question of determining the conditions on the kernel k for which gamma(k) is a metric: such k are denoted characteristic kernels. Unlike pseudometrics, a metric is zero only when two distributions coincide, thus ensuring the RKHS embedding maps all distributions uniquely (i.e., the embedding is injective). While previously published conditions may apply only in restricted circumstances (e. g., on compact domains), and are difficult to check, our conditions are straightforward and intuitive: integrally strictly positive definite kernels are characteristic. Alternatively, if a bounded continuous kernel is translation-invariant on R-d, then it is characteristic if and only if the support of its Fourier transform is the entire R-d. Second, we show that the distance between distributions under gamma(k) results from an interplay between the properties of the kernel and the distributions, by demonstrating that distributions are close in the embedding space when their differences occur at higher frequencies. Third, to understand the nature of the topology induced by g gamma(k), we relate g gamma(k) to other popular metrics on probability measures, and present conditions on the kernel k under which gamma(k) metrizes the weak topology.",,,,,"Schölkopf, Bernhard/A-7570-2013","Schölkopf, Bernhard/0000-0002-8177-0925; Gretton, Arthur/0000-0003-3169-7624; Fukumizu, Kenji/0000-0002-3488-2625",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,APR,2010,11,,,,,,1517,1561,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000282521500009,0

The use of l(1) regularization attributes attractive properties to the classifier, such as feature selection, robustness to noise, and as a result, classifier generality in the context of supervised learning. When a sparse logistic regression problem has large-scale data in high dimensions, it is computationally expensive to minimize the non-differentiable l(1)-norm in the objective function. Motivated by recent work (Koh et al., 2007; Hale et al., 2008), we propose a novel hybrid algorithm based on combining two types of optimization iterations: one being very fast and memory friendly while the other being slower but more accurate. Called hybrid iterative shrinkage (HIS), the resulting algorithm is comprised of a fixed point continuation phase and an interior point phase. The first phase is based completely on memory efficient operations such as matrix-vector multiplications, while the second phase is based on a truncated Newton's method. Furthermore, we show that various optimization techniques, including line search and continuation, can significantly accelerate convergence. The algorithm has global convergence at a geometric rate (a Q-linear rate in optimization terminology). We present a numerical comparison with several existing algorithms, including an analysis using benchmark data from the UCI machine learning repository, and show our algorithm is the most computationally efficient without loss of accuracy.",,,,,"Yin, Wotao/A-5472-2011","Yin, Wotao/0000-0001-6697-9731",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,FEB,2010,11,,,,,,713,741,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000277186500011,0

However, in the statistical setting where we assume that the finite data set has been sampled from some underlying space, the goal is not to find the best partition of the given sample, but to approximate the true partition of the underlying space. We argue that the discrete optimization approach usually does not achieve this goal, and instead can lead to inconsistency. We construct examples which provably have this behavior. As in the case of supervised learning, the cure is to restrict the size of the function classes under consideration. For appropriate small function classes we can prove very general consistency theorems for clustering optimization schemes. As one particular algorithm for clustering with a restricted function space we introduce nearest neighbor clustering.

This approach has opened new perspectives since it makes MKL tractable for large-scale problems, by iteratively using existing support vector machine code. However, it turns out that this iterative algorithm needs numerous iterations for converging towards a reasonable solution. In this paper, we address the MKL problem through a weighted 2-norm regularization formulation with an additional constraint on the weights that encourages sparse kernel combinations. Apart from learning the combination, we solve a standard SVM optimization problem, where the kernel is defined as a linear combination of multiple kernels. We propose an algorithm, named SimpleMKL, for solving this MKL problem and provide a new insight on MKL algorithms based on mixed-norm regularization by showing that the two approaches are equivalent. We show how SimpleMKL can be applied beyond binary classification, for problems like regression, clustering (one-class classification) or multiclass classification.

The case of classes of vector-valued functions used to compute polytomies has seldom been considered independently, which is unsatisfactory, for three main reasons. First, this case encompasses the other ones. Second, it cannot be treated appropriately through a naive extension of the results devoted to the computation of dichotomies. Third, most of the classification problems met in practice involve multiple categories. In this paper, a VC theory of large margin multi-category classifiers is introduced. Central in this theory are generalized VC dimensions called the gamma-Psi-dimensions. First, a uniform convergence bound on the risk of the classifiers of interest is derived. The capacity measure involved in this bound is a covering number. This covering number can be upper bounded in terms of the gamma-Psi-dimensions thanks to generalizations of Sauer's lemma, as is illustrated in the specific case of the scale-sensitive Natarajan dimension. A bound on this latter dimension is then computed for the class of functions on which multi-class SVMs are based.

One type of algorithm aims for noise tolerance by replacing the last hypothesis of the perceptron with another hypothesis or a vote among hypotheses.

A third type borrows further from support vector machines and constrains the update function of the perceptron in ways that mimic soft-margin techniques. The performance of these algorithms, and the potential for combining different techniques, has not been studied in depth. This paper provides such an experimental study and reveals some interesting facts about the algorithms. In particular the perceptron with margin is an effective method for tolerating noise and stabilizing the algorithm. This is surprising since the margin in itself is not designed or used for noise tolerance, and there are no known guarantees for such performance. In most cases, similar performance is obtained by the voted-perceptron which has the advantage that it does not require parameter selection. Techniques using soft margin ideas are run-time intensive and do not give additional performance benefits.

Typical examples include the automatic sorting of URLs into a web directory and the detection of spam email. In this work we present a definition of relevancy based on spectral properties of the Laplacian of the features' measurement matrix. The feature selection process is then based on a continuous ranking of the features defined by a least-squares optimization process. A remarkable property of the feature relevance function is that sparse solutions for the ranking values naturally emerge as a result of a biased non-negativity of a key matrix in the process. As a result, a simple least-squares optimization process converges onto a sparse solution, i.e., a selection of a subset of features which form a local maximum over the relevance function.

A key question in such applications is how much to shrink, or, equivalently, how much to smooth. Empirical Bayes shrinkage methods provide an attractive solution to this problem; they use the data to estimate a distribution of underlying effects, hence automatically select an appropriate amount of shrinkage. However, most existing implementations of empirical Bayes shrinkage are less flexible than they could be-both in their assumptions on the underlying distribution of effects, and in their ability to handle heteroskedasticity-which limits their signal denoising applications. Here we address this by adopting a particularly flexible, stable and computationally convenient empirical Bayes shrinkage method and applying it to several signal denoising problems. These applications include smoothing of Poisson data and heteroskedastic Gaussian data.

This paradigm serves naturally in applications such as severe disease diagnosis and spam detection, where people have clear priorities among the two error types. Recently, Tong et al. (2018) proposed a nonparametric umbrella algorithm that adapts all scoring-type classification methods (e.g., logistic regression, support vector machines, random forest) to respect the given type I error (i.e., conditional probability of classifying a class 0 observation as class 1 under the 0-1 coding) upper bound alpha with high probability, without specific distributional assumptions on the features and the responses. Universal the umbrella algorithm is, it demands an explicit minimum sample size requirement on class 0, which is often the more scarce class, such as in rare disease diagnosis applications. In this work, we employ the parametric linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model and propose a new parametric thresholding algorithm, which does not need the minimum sample size requirements on class 0 observations and thus is suitable for small sample applications such as rare disease diagnosis. Leveraging both the existing nonparametric and the newly proposed parametric thresholding rules, we propose four LDA-based NP classifiers, for both low- and high-dimensional settings. On the theoretical front, we prove NP oracle inequalities for one proposed classifier, where the rate for excess type II error benefits from the explicit parametric model assumption. Furthermore, as NP classifiers involve a sample splitting step of class 0 observations, we construct a new adaptive sample splitting scheme that can be applied universally to NP classifiers, and this adaptive strategy reduces the type II error of these classifiers.

This induces two interesting properties on the model weights of the one-hot encoded features: they are piecewise constant, and are eventually block sparse. Non-asymptotic oracle inequalities for generalized linear models are proposed. Moreover, under a sparse additive model assumption, we prove that our procedure matches the state-of-the-art in this setting. Numerical experiments illustrate the good performances of our approach on several datasets. It is also noteworthy that our method has a numerical complexity comparable to standard l(1) penalization.",,,,,"Alaya, Mokhtar Z./AAM-9242-2021; Guilloux, Agathe/T-2577-2017","Alaya, Mokhtar Z./0000-0002-1103-6944; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2019,20,,,,,,,,118,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000487068900002,0

One of the core challenges associated with learning high-dimensional models is computation since the underlying optimization problems are often non-convex. While convex relaxations could lead to polynomial-time algorithms they are often slow in practice. On the other hand, limited theoretical guarantees exist for non-convex methods. In this paper we provide a general framework that provides theoretical guarantees for learning high-dimensional tensor regression models under different low-rank structural assumptions using the projected gradient descent algorithm applied to a potentially non-convex constraint set Theta in terms of its localized Gaussian width (due to Gaussian design). We juxtapose our theoretical results for non-convex projected gradient descent algorithms with previous results on regularized convex approaches. The two main differences between the convex and non-convex approach are: (i) from a computational perspective whether the non-convex projection operator is computable and whether the projection has desirable contraction properties and (ii) from a statistical error bound perspective, the non-convex approach has a superior rate for a number of examples. We provide three concrete examples of low-dimensional structure which address these issues and explain the pros and cons for the non-convex and convex approaches. We supplement our theoretical results with simulations which show that, under several common settings of generalized low rank tensor regression, the projected gradient descent approach is superior both in terms of statistical error and run-time provided the step-sizes of the projected descent algorithm are suitably chosen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2019,20,,,,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000458662500001,0

We propose a distributed optimization framework where the dataset is encoded to have an over-complete representation with built-in redundancy, and the straggling nodes in the system are dynamically treated as missing, or as erasures at every iteration, whose loss is compensated by the embedded redundancy. For quadratic loss functions, we show that under a simple encoding scheme, many optimization algorithms (gradient descent, L-BFGS, and proximal gradient) operating under data parallelism converge to an approximate solution even when stragglers are ignored. Furthermore, we show a similar result for a wider class of convex loss functions when operating under model parallelism. The applicable classes of objectives covers several popular learning problems such as linear regression, LASSO, support vector machine, collaborative filtering, and generalized linear models including logistic regression. These convergence results are deterministic, i.e., they establish sample path convergence for arbitrary sequences of delay patterns or distributions on the nodes, and are independent of the tail behavior of the delay distribution.

Unfortunately, conducting the theoretical analysis asynchronous methods is difficult, notably due to the introduction of delay and inconsistency in inherently sequential algorithms. Handling these issues often requires resorting to simplifying but unrealistic assumptions. Through a novel perspective, we revisit and clarify a subtle but important technical issue present in a large fraction of the recent convergence rate proofs for asynchronous parallel optimization algorithms, and propose a simplification of the recently introduced perturbed iterate framework that resolves it. We demonstrate the usefulness of our new framework by analyzing three distinct asynchronous parallel incremental optimization algorithms: Hogwild asynchronous Sgd), Kromagnon asynchronous Svrg) and Asaga, a novel asynchronous parallel version of the incremental gradient algorithm Saga that enjoys fast linear convergence rates.

We present results of an implementation on a 40-core architecture illustrating the practical speedups as well as the hardware overhead.

Our goal is to devise learning algorithms that are efficient and statistically consistent with respect to commonly used utility measures. In particular, we look at a family of measures motivated by their application in domains where cost-sensitive learning is necessary (for example, when there is class imbalance). In contrast to most of the existing literature on consistent classification that are limited to the classical 0-1 loss, our analysis includes more general utility measures such as the AM measure (arithmetic mean of True Positive Rate and True Negative Rate). For this problem of cost-sensitive learning under class-conditional random noise, we develop two approaches that are based on suitably modifying surrogate losses. First, we provide a simple unbiased estimator of any loss, and obtain performance bounds for empirical utility maximization in the presence of i.i.d. data with noisy labels. If the loss function satisfies a simple symmetry condition, we show that using unbiased estimator leads to an efficient algorithm for empirical maximization. Second, by leveraging a reduction of risk minimization under noisy labels to classification with weighted 0-1 loss, we suggest the use of a simple weighted surrogate loss, for which we are able to obtain strong utility bounds. This approach implies that methods already used in practice, such as biased SVM and weighted logistic regression, are provably noise-tolerant.

We assume the availability of an offline (alpha,beta)-approximation oracle that takes the means of the outcome distributions of arms and outputs a super arm that with probability beta generates an alpha fraction of the optimal expected reward. The objective of an online learning algorithm for CMAB is to minimize (alpha,beta)-approximation regret, which is the difference between the alpha,beta fraction of the expected reward when always playing the optimal super arm, and the expected reward of playing super arms according to the algorithm. We provide CUCB algorithm that achieves O(log n) distribution-dependent regret, where n is the number of rounds played, and we further provide distribution-independent bounds for a large class of reward functions. Our regret analysis is tight in that it matches the bound of UCB1 algorithm (up to a constant factor) for the classical MAB problem, and it significantly improves the regret bound in a earlier paper on combinatorial bandits with linear rewards. We apply our CMAB framework to two new applications, probabilistic maximum coverage and social influence maximization, both having nonlinear reward structures. In particular, application to social influence maximization requires our extension on probabilistically triggered arms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2016,17,,,,,,,,50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000391486100001,0

This heterogeneity makes treatment difficult for caregivers because they cannot accurately predict the way in which the disease will progress in order to guide treatment decisions. Therefore, tools that help to predict the trajectory of these complex chronic diseases can help to improve the quality of health care. To build such tools, we can leverage clinical markers that are collected at baseline when a patient first presents and longitudinally over time during follow-up visits. Because complex chronic diseases are typically systemic, the longitudinal markers often track disease progression in multiple organ systems. In this paper, our goal is to predict a function of time that models the future trajectory of a single target clinical marker tracking a disease process of interest. We want to make these predictions using the histories of many related clinical markers as input. Our proposed solution tackles several key challenges. First, we can easily handle irregularly and sparsely sampled markers, which are standard in clinical data. Second, the number of parameters and the computational complexity of learning our model grows linearly in the number of marker types included in the model. This makes our approach applicable to diseases where many different markers are recorded over time. Finally, our model accounts for latent factors influencing disease expression, whereas standard regression models rely on observed features alone to explain variability. Moreover, our approach can be applied dynamically in continous-time and updates its predictions as soon as any new data is available. We apply our approach to the problem of predicting lung disease trajectories in scleroderma, a complex autoimmune disease. We show that our model improves over state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy and we provide a qualitative analysis of our model's output. Finally, the variability of disease presentation in scleroderma makes clinical trial recruitment challenging. We show that a prognostic tool that integrates multiple types of routinely collected longitudinal data can be used to identify individuals at greatest risk of rapid progression and to target trial recruitment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2016,17,,,,,,1,35,232,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000391918600001,0

We develop a structured Bayesian group factor analysis model that extends the factor model to multiple coupled observation matrices; in the case of two observations, this reduces to a Bayesian model of canonical correlation analysis. Here, we carefully define a structured Bayesian prior that encourages both element-wise and column-wise shrinkage and leads to desirable behavior on high-dimensional data. In particular, our model puts a structured prior on the joint factor loading matrix, regularizing at three levels, which enables element-wise sparsity and unsupervised recovery of latent factors corresponding to structured variance across arbitrary subsets of the observations. In addition, our structured prior allows for both dense and sparse latent factors so that covariation among either all features or only a subset of features can be recovered.

Classical regularization enforces a cost on classifier complexity, by constraining parameters. This is usually combined with a margin loss, which favors large-margin decision rules. A novel and unified view of this architecture is proposed, by showing that margin losses act as regularizers of posterior class probabilities, in a way that amplifies classical parameter regularization. The problem of controlling the regularization strength of a margin loss is considered, using a decomposition of the loss in terms of a link and a binding function. The link function is shown to be responsible for the regularization strength of the loss, while the binding function determines its outlier robustness. A large class of losses is then categorized into equivalence classes of identical regularization strength or outlier robustness. It is shown that losses in the same regularization class can be parameterized so as to have tunable regularization strength. This parameterization is finally used to derive boosting algorithms with loss regularization (BoostLR). Three classes of tunable regularization losses are considered in detail. Canonical losses can implement all regularization behaviors but have no flexibility in terms of outlier modeling. Shrinkage losses support equally parameterized link and binding functions, leading to boosting algorithms that implement the popular shrinkage procedure. This offers a new explanation for shrinkage as a special case of loss-based regularization. Finally, ca-tunable losses enable the independent parameterization of link and binding functions, leading to boosting algorithms of great flexibility. This is illustrated by the derivation of an algorithm that generalizes both AdaBoost and LogitBoost, behaving as either one when that best suits the data to classify.

This partitioning leads to a substantial reduction in computation time versus the standard approach of performing kernel ridge regression on all N samples. Our two main theorems establish that despite the computational speed-up, statistical optimality is retained: as long as m is not too large, the partition-based estimator achieves the statistical minimax rate over all estimators using the set of N samples.

We begin with rational agents with unlimited resources and then move to a setting where an agent can only maintain a limited number of hypotheses and optimizes plans over a horizon much shorter than what the agent designer actually wants. We axiomatize what is rational in such a setting in a manner that enables optimism, which is important to achieve systematic explorative behavior. Then, within the class of agents deemed rational, we achieve convergence and finite-error bounds. Such results are desirable since they imply that the agent learns well from its experiences, but the bounds do not directly guarantee good performance and can be achieved by agents doing things one should obviously not. Good performance cannot in fact be guaranteed for any agent in fully general settings. Our approach is to design agents that learn well from experience and act rationally. We introduce a framework for general reinforcement learning agents based on rationality axioms for a decision function and an hypothesis-generating function designed so as to achieve guarantees on the number errors. We will consistently use an optimistic decision function but the hypothesis-generating function needs to change depending on what is known/assumed.

We assume both p and n are large, including the case of p >> n. The unknown signal vector beta is assumed to be sparse in the sense that only a small fraction of its components is nonzero. The goal is to identify such nonzero coordinates (i.e., variable selection). We are primarily interested in the regime where signals are both rare and weak so that successful variable selection is challenging but is still possible. We assume the Gram matrix G = X' X is sparse in the sense that each row has relatively few large entries (diagonals of G are normalized to 1). The sparsity of G naturally induces the sparsity of the so-called Graph of Strong Dependence (GOSD). The key insight is that there is an interesting interplay between the signal sparsity and graph sparsity: in a broad context, the signals decompose into many small-size components of GOSD that are disconnected to each other. We propose Graphlet Screening for variable selection. This is a two-step Screen and Clean procedure, where in the first step, we screen subgraphs of GOSD with sequential chi(2)-tests, and in the second step, we clean with penalized MLE. The main methodological innovation is to use GOSD to guide both the screening and cleaning processes. For any variable selection procedure beta, we measure its performance by the Hamming distance between the sign vectors of beta and beta, and assess the optimality by the minimax Hamming distance. Compared with more stringent criteria such as exact support recovery or oracle property, which demand strong signals, the Hamming distance criterion is more appropriate for weak signals since it naturally allows a small fraction of errors. We show that in a broad class of situations, Graphlet Screening achieves the optimal rate of convergence in terms of the Hamming distance. Unlike Graphlet Screening, well-known procedures such as the L-0/L-1-penalization methods do not utilize local graphic structure for variable selection, so they generally do not achieve the optimal rate of convergence, even in very simple settings and even if the tuning parameters are ideally set.

Inspired by this new framework for analysing bounds, we propose a new, simple reweighing scheme which provides a provably unbiased estimator for arbitrary model/distribution pairs-an unusual property for a semi-supervised algorithm. This reweighing introduces no additional computational complexity and can be applied to very many models. Additionally, we provide specific conditions demonstrating the circumstance under which the unlabelled data will lower the estimator variance, thereby improving convergence.",,,,,,"Rosten, Edward/0000-0001-8675-4230",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,FEB,2014,15,,,,,,367,443,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000335457700001,0

First, we describe cautious inference and explain how four well-known families of CC algorithms can be parameterized to use varying degrees of such caution. Second, we introduce cautious learning and show how it can be used to improve the performance of almost any CC algorithm, with or without cautious inference. We then evaluate cautious inference and learning for the four collective inference families, with three local classifiers and a range of both synthetic and real-world data. We find that cautious learning and cautious inference typically outperform less cautious approaches.

Within the context of the linear model, Fan & Lv ( 2008) showed that this simple correlation ranking possesses a sure independence screening property under certain conditions and that its revision, called iteratively sure independent screening ( ISIS), is needed when the features are marginally unrelated but jointly related to the response variable.

The efficiency of this strategy for a complex pose, that is, for fine-grained descriptions, can be assessed by measuring the effect of sample size and pose resolution on accuracy and computation. Two conclusions emerge: (1) fragmenting the training data, which is inevitable in dealing with high in-class variation, severely reduces accuracy; (2) the computational cost at high resolution is prohibitive due to visiting a massive pose partition. To overcome data-fragmentation we propose a novel framework centered on pose-indexed features which assign a response to a pair consisting of an image and a pose, and are designed to be stationary: the probability distribution of the response is always the same if an object is actually present. Such features allow for efficient, one-shot learning of pose-specific classifiers. To avoid expensive scene processing, we arrange these classifiers in a hierarchy based on nested partitions of the pose; as in previous work on coarse-to-fine search, this allows for efficient processing. The hierarchy is then folded for training: all the classifiers at each level are derived from one base predictor learned from all the data. The hierarchy is unfolded for testing: parsing a scene amounts to examining increasingly finer object descriptions only when there is sufficient evidence for coarser ones. In this way, the detection results are equivalent to an exhaustive search at high resolution. We illustrate these ideas by detecting and localizing cats in highly cluttered greyscale scenes.",,,,,"Geman, Donald/A-3325-2010",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,NOV,2008,9,,,,,,2549,2578,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000262637600006,0

We show that for the concept class of intervals on the real line an agent using a bounded number of queries per oracle exists. In contrast, for the concept class of unions of two intervals on the real line no agent with a bounded number of queries per oracle exists. We then investigate the (amortized) number of queries per oracle needed for the shaped search problem over other concept classes. We explore the following methods to obtain efficient agents.

As main results we establish upper and lower bounds on the dimension of the inner product space for Bayesian networks with an explicitly given (full or reduced) parameter collection. In particular, these bounds are tight up to a factor of 2. For some nontrivial cases of Bayesian networks we even determine the exact values of this dimension. We further consider logistic autoregressive Bayesian networks and show that every sufficiently expressive inner product space must have dimension at least Omega(n(2)), where n is the number of network nodes. We also derive the bound 2(Omega(n)) for an artificial variant of this network, thereby demonstrating the limits of our approach and raising an interesting open question. As a major technical contribution, this work reveals combinatorial and algebraic structures within Bayesian networks such that known methods for the derivation of lower bounds on the dimension of inner product spaces can be brought into play.",,,,,,"Nakamura, Atsuyoshi/0000-0001-7078-8655; Schmitt, Niels/0000-0002-8329-6833; Simon, Hans/0000-0002-1587-0944",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,SEP,2005,6,,,,,,1383,1403,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000236330100005,0

The problem is one of detecting rare events in a time series of noisy and nonparametrically-distributed data. We develop a new algorithm based on the multiple-instance learning framework and the naive Bayesian classifier (mi-NB) which is specifically designed for the low false-alarm case, and is shown to have promising performance. Other methods compared are support vector machines (SVMs), unsupervised clustering, and non-parametric statistical tests (rank-sum and reverse arrangements). The failure-prediction performance of the SVM, rank-sum and mi-NB algorithm is considerably better than the threshold method currently implemented in drives, while maintaining low false alarm rates. Our results suggest that nonparametric statistical tests should be considered for learning problems involving detecting rare events in time series data. An appendix details the calculation of rank-sum significance probabilities in the case of discrete, tied observations, and we give new recommendations about when the exact calculation should be used instead of the commonly-used normal approximation.

It is demonstrated that, if a nonlinear conic approximation scheme is considered that is (in an appropriately defined sense) more expressive than a classical linear approximation approach and if there exist unrealizable label vectors, then a training problem with squared loss is necessarily unstable in the sense that its solution set depends discontinuously on the label vector in the training data. We further prove that the same effects that are responsible for these instability properties are also the reason for the emergence of saddle points and spurious local minima, which may be arbitrarily far away from global solutions, and that neither the instability of the training problem nor the existence of spurious local minima can, in general, be overcome by adding a regularization term to the objective function that penalizes the size of the parameters in the approximation scheme. The latter results are shown to be true regardless of whether the assumption of realizability is satisfied or not. It is further established that there exists a direct and quantifiable relationship between the analyzed instability properties and the expressiveness of the considered approximation instrument and that the set of training label vectors and, in the regularized case, Tikhonov regularization parameters that give rise to spurious local minima has a nonempty interior. We demonstrate that our analysis in particular applies to training problems for free-knot interpolation schemes and deep and shallow neural networks with variable widths that involve an arbitrary mixture of various activation functions (e.g., binary, sigmoid, tanh, arctan, soft-sign, ISRU, soft-clip, SQNL, ReLU, leaky ReLU, soft-plus, bent identity, SILU, ISRLU, and ELU).

Numerical results confirm our theoretical predictions and demonstrate the superiority of DIHT to the state-of-the-art primal IHT-style algorithms in model estimation accuracy and computational efficiency.(1)",,,,,"Liu, Qing/GWC-9222-2022; liu, qingqing/HHD-0360-2022",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2020,21,,,,,,,,152,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000570114500001,0

We present a fast two-stage procedure based on spectral initialization followed by the application of a pseudo-likelihood classifier twice. Under mild regularity conditions, we establish the weak consistency of the procedure (i.e., the convergence of the misclassification rate to zero) under a general bipartite stochastic block model. We show that the procedure is optimal in the sense that it achieves the optimal convergence rate that is achievable by a biclustering oracle, adaptively over the whole class, up to constants. This is further formalized by deriving a minimax lower bound over a class of biclustering problems. The optimal rate we obtain sharpens some of the existing results and generalizes others to a wide regime of average degree growth, from sparse networks with average degrees growing arbitrarily slowly to fairly dense networks with average degrees of order root n. As a special case, we recover the known exact recovery threshold in the log n regime of sparsity. To obtain the consistency result, as part of the provable version of the algorithm, we introduce a sub-block partitioning scheme that is also computationally attractive, allowing for distributed implementation of the algorithm without sacrificing optimality. The provable algorithm is derived from a general class of pseudo-likelihood biclustering algorithms that employ simple EM type updates.

Despite their non-convexity, gradient-descent methods often successfully optimize these models. This has motivated a recent spur in research attempting to characterize properties of their loss surface that may explain such success. In this paper, we address this phenomenon by studying a key topological property of the loss: the presence or absence of spurious valleys, defined as connected components of sub-level sets that do not include a global minimum. Focusing on a class of one-hidden-layer neural networks defined by smooth (but generally non-linear) activation functions, we identify a notion of intrinsic dimension and show that it provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the absence of spurious valleys. More concretely, finite intrinsic dimension guarantees that for sufficiently overparametrised models no spurious valleys exist, independently of the data distribution. Conversely, infinite intrinsic dimension implies that spurious valleys do exist for certain data distributions, independently of model overparametrisation. Besides these positive and negative results, we show that, although spurious valleys may exist in general, they are confined to low risk levels and avoided with high probability on overparametrised models.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2019,20,,,,,,,,133,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000487068900017,0

In this paper, we propose a multi-round distributed linear-type (MDL) estimator for conducting inference for linear SVM. The proposed estimator is computationally efficient. In particular, it only requires an initial SVM estimator and then successively refines the estimator by solving simple weighted least squares problem. Theoretically, we establish the Bahadur representation of the estimator.

Moreover, our asymptotic result avoids the condition on the number of machines or data batches, which is commonly assumed in distributed estimation literature, and allows the case of diverging dimension.

Here we show that by generalizing the classical definition of graphons as functions over probability spaces to functions over sigma-finite measure spaces, we can model a large family of exchangeable graphs, including the Caron-Fox graphs and the traditional exchangeable dense graphs as special cases. Explicitly, modelling the underlying space of features by a sigma-finite measure space (S, S, mu) and the connection probabilities by an integrable function W : S x S -> [ 0,1], we construct a random family (G(t))(t) (>= 0) of growing graphs such that the vertices of G(t) are given by a Poisson point process on S with intensity t mu, with two points x, y of the point process connected with probability W(x,y). We call such a random family a graphon process. We prove that a graphon process has convergent subgraph frequencies (with possibly in finite limits) and that, in the natural extension of the cut metric to our setting, the sequence converges to the generating graphon. We also show that the underlying graphon is identifiable only as an equivalence class over graphons with cut distance zero. More generally, we study metric convergence for arbitrary (not necessarily random) sequences of graphs, and show that a sequence of graphs has a convergent subsequence if and only if it has a subsequence satisfying a property we call uniform regularity of tails.

There are good reasons to do so: natural distributions such as the uniform and Gaussian violate the condition. We give regret bounds for both bounded support and unbounded support distributions without assuming the hazard rate condition.

Characteristic kernels play an important role in machine learning applications with their kernel means to distinguish any two probability measures. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we show, using the Levy-Khintchine formula, that any shift-invariant kernel given by a bounded, continuous, and symmetric probability density function (pdf) of an infinitely divisible distribution on R-d is characteristic. We mention some closure properties of such characteristic kernels under addition, pointwise product, and convolution. Second, in developing various kernel mean algorithms, it is fundamental to compute the following values: (i) kernel mean values m(p)(x), x is an element of X, and (ii) kernel mean RKHS inner products < m(P), m(Q)> (H), for probability measures P; Q. If P; Q, and kernel k are Gaussians, then the computation of (i) and (ii) results in Gaussian pdfs that are tractable. We generalize this Gaussian combination to more general cases in the class of in finitely divisible distributions. We then introduce a conjugate kernel and a convolution trick, so that the above (i) and (ii) have the same pdf form, expecting tractable computation at least in some cases.

Their appeal comes from their good performance, low computational cost, and their simple interpretation, given by their forward view. Recently, new versions of these methods were introduced, called true online TD(lambda) and true online Sarsa(lambda), respectively (van Seijen & Sutton, 2014). Algorithmically, these true online methods only make two small changes to the update rules of the regular methods, and the extra computational cost is negligible in most cases. However, they follow the ideas underlying the forward view much more closely. In particular, they maintain an exact equivalence with the forward view at all times, whereas the traditional versions only approximate it for small step-sizes. We hypothesize that these true online methods not only have better theoretical properties, but also dominate the regular methods empirically. In this article, we put this hypothesis to the test by performing an extensive empirical comparison. Specifically, we compare the performance of true online TD(lambda)/Sarsa(lambda) with regular TD(lambda)/Sarsa(lambda) on random MRPs, a real-world myoelectric prosthetic arm, and a domain from the Arcade Learning Environment. We use linear function approximation with tabular, binary, and non-binary features. Our results suggest that the true online methods indeed dominate the regular methods. Across all domains/representations the learning speed of the true online methods are often better, but never worse than that of the regular methods. An additional advantage is that no choice between traces has to be made for the true online methods. Besides the empirical results, we provide an in-dept analysis of the theory behind true online temporal-difference learning. In addition, we show that new true online temporal-difference methods can be derived by making changes to the online forward view and then rewriting the update equations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2016,17,,,,,,,,145,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000391661800001,0

However, how to learn risk scores for time-to-event outcomes subject to right censoring has received little attention until recently. Existing approaches rely on inverse probability weighting or rank-based regression, which may be inefficient. In this paper, we develop a new support vector hazards machine (SVHM) approach to predict censored outcomes. Our method is based on predicting the counting process associated with the time-to-event outcomes among subjects at risk via a series of support vector machines. Introducing counting processes to represent time-to-event data leads to a connection between support vector machines in supervised learning and hazards regression in standard survival analysis. To account for different at risk populations at observed event times, a time-varying off set is used in estimating risk scores. The resulting optimization is a convex quadratic programming problem that can easily incorporate nonlinearity using kernel trick. We demonstrate an interesting link from the pro filed empirical risk function of SVHM to the Cox partial likelihood. We then formally show that SVHM is optimal in discriminating covariate-specific hazard function from population average hazard function, and establish the consistency and learning rate of the predicted risk using the estimated risk scores. Simulation studies show improved prediction accuracy of the event times using SVHM compared to existing machine learning methods and standard conventional approaches. Finally, we analyze two real world biomedical study data where we use clinical markers and neuroimaging biomarkers to predict age-at-onset of a disease, and demonstrate superiority of SVHM in distinguishing high risk versus low risk subjects.",,,,,,"Wang, Yu-Xiang/0000-0002-6403-212X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2016,17,,,,,,1,37,167,,,,,,,,,,28066157,,,,,WOS:000391671800001,0

In these cases, the subset of elements is assumed to be sampled uniformly at random. In this paper, we show that any rank-r n-by-n matrix can be exactly recovered from as few as O(nr log(2) n) randomly chosen elements, provided this random choice is made according to a specific biased distribution suitably dependent on the coherence structure of the matrix: the probability of any element being sampled should be at least a constant times the sum of the leverage scores of the corresponding row and column. Moreover, we prove that this specific form of sampling is nearly necessary, in a natural precise sense; this implies that many other perhaps more intuitive sampling schemes fail. We further establish three ways to use the above result for the setting when leverage scores are not known a priori. (a) We describe a provably-correct sampling strategy for the case when only the column space is incoherent and no assumption or knowledge of the row space is required. (b) We propose a two-phase sampling procedure for general matrices that first samples to estimate leverage scores followed by sampling for exact recovery. These two approaches assume control over the sampling procedure.

A sound theoretical understanding of dropout is needed to determine when dropout should be applied and how to use it most effectively. In this paper we continue the exploration of dropout as a regularizer pioneered by Wager et al. We focus on linear classification where a convex proxy to the misclassification loss (i.e. the logistic loss used in logistic regression) is minimized. We show: center dot when the dropout-regularized criterion has a unique minimizer, center dot when the dropout-regularization penalty goes to infinity with the weights, and when it remains bounded, center dot that the dropout regularization can be non-monotonic as individual weights increase from 0, and center dot that the dropout regularization penalty may not be convex. This last point is particularly surprising because the combination of dropout regularization with any convex loss proxy is always a convex function. In order to contrast dropout regularization with L-2 regularization, we formalize the notion of when different random sources of data are more compatible with different regularizers. We then exhibit distributions that are provably more compatible with dropout regularization than L-2 regularization, and vice versa. These sources provide additional insight into how the inductive biases of dropout and L-2 regularization differ.

Symbolic mismatch identifies functional units in long-term signals and measures changes in the morphology and frequency of these units across patients. Second, we describe similarity-based algorithms that are unsupervised and do not require comparisons to patients with known outcomes for risk stratification. This is achieved by using an anomaly detection framework to identify patients who are unlike other patients in a population and may potentially be at an elevated risk. We demonstrate the potential utility of our approach by showing how symbolic mismatch-based algorithms can be used to classify patients as being at high or low risk of major adverse cardiac events by comparing their long-term electrocardiograms to that of a large population. We describe how symbolic mismatch can be used in three different existing methods: one-class support vector machines, nearest neighbor analysis, and hierarchical clustering. When evaluated on a population of 686 patients with available long-term electrocardiographic data, symbolic mismatch-based comparative approaches were able to identify patients at roughly a two-fold increased risk of major adverse cardiac events in the 90 days following acute coronary syndrome. These results were consistent even after adjusting for other clinical risk variables.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,MAR,2011,12,,,,,,999,1024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000289635000008,0

In this work we present a novel method for learning Bayesian networks of bounded treewidth that employs global structure modifications and that is polynomial both in the size of the graph and the treewidth bound. At the heart of our method is a dynamic triangulation that we update in a way that facilitates the addition of chain structures that increase the bound on the model's treewidth by at most one. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our treewidth-friendly method on several real-life data sets and show that it is superior to the greedy approach as soon as the bound on the treewidth is nontrivial.

In the best case, kernels provide efficient implicit representations of the data for supervised learning problems. Practically, we propose an algorithm which enables us to recover the number of leading kernel PCA components relevant for good classification.

We show that the kernel learning problem in RKDA can be formulated as convex programs. First, we show that this problem can be formulated as a semidefinite program (SDP). Based on the equivalence relationship between RKDA and least square problems in the binary-class case, we propose a convex quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) formulation for kernel learning in RKDA. A semi-infinite linear programming (SILP) formulation is derived to further improve the efficiency. We extend these formulations to the multi-class case based on a key result established in this paper. That is, the multi-class RKDA kernel learning problem can be decomposed into a set of binary-class kernel learning problems which are constrained to share a common kernel. Based on this decomposition property, SDP formulations are proposed for the multi-class case. Furthermore, it leads naturally to QCQP and SILP formulations.

In this paper, we tackle the combinatorial optimization problem of maximizing the mutual information between the chosen locations and the locations which are not selected. We prove that the problem of finding the configuration that maximizes mutual information is NP-complete. To address this issue, we describe a polynomial-time approximation that is within (1-1/e) of the optimum by exploiting the submodularity of mutual information. We also show how submodularity can be used to obtain online bounds, and design branch and bound search procedures. We then extend our algorithm to exploit lazy evaluations and local structure in the GP, yielding significant speedups. We also extend our approach to find placements which are robust against node failures and uncertainties in the model.

The AUC is a different term than the error rate used for evaluation in classification problems; consequently, existing generalization bounds for the classification error rate cannot be used to draw conclusions about the AUC. In this paper, we define the expected accuracy of a ranking function (analogous to the expected error rate of a classification function), and derive distribution-free probabilistic bounds on the deviation of the empirical AUC of a ranking function (observed on a finite data sequence) from its expected accuracy. We derive both a large deviation bound, which serves to bound the expected accuracy of a ranking function in terms of its empirical AUC on a test sequence, and a uniform convergence bound, which serves to bound the expected accuracy of a learned ranking function in terms of its empirical AUC on a training sequence. Our uniform convergence bound is expressed in terms of a new set of combinatorial parameters that we term the bipartite rank-shatter coefficients; these play the same role in our result as do the standard VC-dimension related shatter coefficients (also known as the growth function) in uniform convergence results for the classification error rate.

J,"Elidan, G; Friedman, N",,,,"Elidan, G; Friedman, N",,,Learning hidden variable networks: The information bottleneck approach,JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,"A central challenge in learning probabilistic graphical models is dealing with domains that involve hidden variables. The common approach for learning model parameters in such domains is the expectation maximization ( EM) algorithm. This algorithm, however, can easily get trapped in suboptimal local maxima. Learning the model structure is even more challenging. The structural EM algorithm can adapt the structure in the presence of hidden variables, but usually performs poorly without prior knowledge about the cardinality and location of the hidden variables. In this work, we present a general approach for learning Bayesian networks with hidden variables that overcomes these problems. The approach builds on the information bottleneck framework of Tishby et al. (1999). We start by proving formal correspondence between the information bottleneck objective and the standard parametric EM functional. We then use this correspondence to construct a learning algorithm that combines an information-theoretic smoothing term with a continuation procedure. Intuitively, the algorithm bypasses local maxima and achieves superior solutions by following a continuous path from a solution of, an easy and smooth, target function, to a solution of the desired likelihood function. As we show, our algorithmic framework allows learning of the parameters as well as the structure of a network. In addition, it also allows us to introduce new hidden variables during model selection and learn their cardinality.

We are mainly concerned about the regularization error. It is estimated for general distributions by a K-functional in weighted L-q spaces. For weakly separable distributions (i.e., the margin may be zero) satisfactory convergence rates are provided by means of separating functions. A projection operator is introduced, which leads to better sample error estimates especially for small complexity kernels.

Following this connection, we model the distribution of event time through an ordinary differential equation and utilize efficient ODE solvers and adjoint sensitivity analysis to numerically evaluate the likelihood and the gradients.

Our approach achieves feature sparsity by adding a skip (residual) layer and allowing a feature to participate in any hidden layer only if its skip-layer representative is active. Unlike other approaches to feature selection for neural nets, our method uses a modified objective function with constraints, and so integrates feature selection with the parameter learning directly. As a result, it delivers an entire regularization path of solutions with a range of feature sparsity.

In addition to its capacity of providing preference-based recommendations as an unsupervised learning methodology, it has been also proven useful in sales forecasting, product introduction and other production related businesses. Since some consumers and companies need a recommendation or prediction for future budget, labor and supply chain coordination, dynamic recommender systems for precise forecasting have become extremely necessary. In this article, we propose a new recommendation method, namely the dynamic tensor recommender system (DTRS), which aims particularly at forecasting future recommendation. The proposed method utilizes a tensor-valued function of time to integrate time and contextual information, and creates a time-varying coefficient model for temporal tensor factorization through a polynomial spline approximation. Major advantages of the proposed method include competitive future recommendation predictions and effective prediction interval estimations. In theory, we establish the convergence rate of the proposed tensor factorization and asymptotic normality of the spline coefficient estimator. The proposed method is applied to simulations, IRI marketing data and Last.fm data.

In this context, verification involves proving or disproving that an NN model satisfies certain input-output properties. Despite the reputation of learned NN models as black boxes, and the theoretical hardness of proving useful properties about them, researchers have been successful in verifying some classes of models by exploiting their piecewise linear structure and taking insights from formal methods such as Satisifiability Modulo Theory. However, these methods are still far from scaling to realistic neural networks.

Several ITR methods have been proposed in both the binary setting and the multicategory setting. In practice, one may prefer a more flexible recommendation that includes multiple treatment options.

We performed extensive experiments on the persistent homology of a wide range of point cloud data sets, both real and simulated. The results consistently demonstrate the following: (1) Neural networks operate by changing topology, transforming a topologically complicated data set into a topologically simple one as it passes through the layers. No matter how complicated the topology of M we begin with, when passed through a well-trained neural network f : R-d -> R-p, there is a vast reduction in the Betti numbers of both components Ma and Mb; in fact they nearly always reduce to their lowest possible values: beta(k)(f(M-i)) = 0 for k >= 1 and beta(0)(f(M-i)) = 1, i = a, b. (2) The reduction in Betti numbers is significantly faster for ReLU activation than for hyperbolic tangent activation as the former defines nonhomeomorphic maps that change topology, whereas the latter defines homeomorphic maps that preserve topology.

The choice of these models as well as the corresponding training processes are subject to the bias/variance tradeoff, also known as under- and overfitting: simple models cannot capture complex interactions between problem variables, whereas complex models are susceptible to modeling random noise. This paper suggests using Denoising Autoencoders (DAEs) as generative models within EDAs (DAE-EDA). The resulting DAE-EDA is able to model complex probability distributions. Furthermore, overfitting is less harmful, since DAEs overfit by learning the identity function. This overfitting behavior introduces unbiased random noise into the samples, which is no major problem for the EDA but just leads to higher population diversity. As a result, DAE-EDA runs for more generations before convergence and searches promising parts of the solution space more thoroughly. We study the performance of DAE-EDA on several combinatorial single-objective optimization problems. In comparison to the Bayesian Optimization Algorithm, DAE-EDA requires a similar number of evaluations of the objective function but is much faster and can be parallelized efficiently, making it the preferred choice especially for large and difficult optimization problems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2020,21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000542194600001,0

Customers independently make purchasing decisions according to a general choice model that includes products features and customers' characteristics, encoded as d-dimensional numerical vectors, as well as the price offered. The parameters of the choice model are a priori unknown to the firm, but can be learned as the (binary-valued) sales data accrues over time. The firm's objective is to maximize its revenue. We benchmark the performance using the classic regret minimization framework where the regret is de fined as the expected revenue loss against a clairvoyant policy that knows the parameters of the choice model in advance, and always offers the revenue-maximizing price. This setting is motivated in part by the prevalence of online marketplaces that allow for real-time pricing. We assume a structured choice model, parameters of which depend on s(0) out of the d product features. Assuming that the market noise distribution is known, we propose a dynamic policy, called Regularized Maximum Likelihood Pricing (RMLP) that leverages the (sparsity) structure of the high-dimensional model and obtains a logarithmic regret in T. More specifically, the regret of our algorithm is of O(s(0) log d . log T). Furthermore, we show that no policy can obtain regret better than O(s(0) (log d + log T)).

Under a sparse Riesz condition on the design matrix and certain other conditions, we show that with high probability, the l(2) estimation error of the solution sequence decays exponentially to the minimax error bound in O(log(R root J)) iterations, where J is the number of important predictors and R is the relative magnitude of the nonzero target coefficients; and under a mutual coherence condition and certain other conditions, the l(infinity) estimation error decays to the optimal error bound in O(log(R)) iterations. Moreover the SDAR solution recovers the oracle least squares estimator within a finite number of iterations with high probability if the sparsity level is known. Computational complexity analysis shows that the cost of SDAR is O(np) per iteration.

We note that both can be formulated in a natural way in a latent variable model, in which both the interesting signal and the noise are mediated through the same latent factors. Under this assumption, the signal model then borrows strength from the noise model by encouraging similar effects on correlated targets. We introduce a hyperparameter for the latent signal-to-noise ratio which turns out to be important for modelling weak signals, and an ordered infinite dimensional shrinkage prior that resolves the rotational unidentifiability in reduced-rank regression models.

To address this fundamental challenge in crowdsourcing, we propose a simple payment mechanism to incentivize workers to answer only the questions that they are sure of and skip the rest. We show that surprisingly, under a mild and natural no-free-lunch requirement, this mechanism is the one and only incentive-compatible payment mechanism possible. We also show that among all possible incentive-compatible mechanisms (that may or may not satisfy no-freelunch), our mechanism makes the smallest possible payment to spammers. We further extend our results to a more general setting in which workers are required to provide a quantized confidence for each question. Interestingly, this unique mechanism takes a multiplicative form. The simplicity of the mechanism is an added benefit.

The recently proposed stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) method circumvents this problem in three ways: it generates proposed moves using only a subset of the data, it skips the Metropolis-Hastings accept-reject step, and it uses sequences of decreasing step sizes. In Teh et al. (2014), we provided the mathematical foundations for the decreasing step size SGLD, including consistency and a central limit theorem. However, in practice the SGLD is run for a relatively small number of iterations, and its step size is not decreased to zero. The present article investigates the behaviour of the SGLD with fixed step size. In particular we characterise the asymptotic bias explicitly, along with its dependence on the step size and the variance of the stochastic gradient. On that basis a modified SGLD which removes the asymptotic bias due to the variance of the stochastic gradients up to first order in the step size is derived. Moreover, we are able to obtain bounds on the finite-time bias, variance and mean squared error (MSE). The theory is illustrated with a Gaussian toy model for which the bias and the MSE for the estimation of moments can be obtained explicitly. For this toy model we study the gain of the SGLD over the standard Euler method in the limit of large data sets.",,,,,"Zygalakis, Konstantinos/AAZ-8636-2020","Zygalakis, Konstantinos/0000-0002-3860-9167",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2016,17,,,,,,1,45,159,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000391667500001,0

In this way, we obtain the first optimal column selection algorithm for the prototype model. We also prove that the prototype model is exact under certain conditions. Second, we develop a simple column selection algorithm with a provable error bound.

Demonstrations of the value of training with unlabeled data typically depend on a smoothness assumption relating the conditional expectation to high density regions of the marginal distribution and an inherent missing completely at random assumption for the labeling. So-called covariate shift poses a challenge for many existing semi-supervised or supervised learning techniques. Covariate shift models allow the marginal distributions of the labeled and unlabeled feature data to differ, but the conditional distribution of the response given the feature data is the same. An example of this occurs when a complete labeled data sample and then an unlabeled sample are obtained sequentially, as it would likely follow that the distributions of the feature data are quite different between samples. The value of using unlabeled data during training for the elastic net is justified geometrically in such practical covariate shift problems. The approach works by obtaining adjusted coefficients for unlabeled prediction which recalibrate the supervised elastic net to compromise: (i) maintaining elastic net predictions on the labeled data with (ii) shrinking unlabeled predictions to zero. Our approach is shown to dominate linear supervised alternatives on unlabeled response predictions when the unlabeled feature data are concentrated on a low dimensional manifold away from the labeled data and the true coefficient vector emphasizes directions away from this manifold. Large variance of the supervised predictions on the unlabeled set is reduced more than the increase in squared bias when the unlabeled responses are expected to be small, so an improved compromise within the bias-variance tradeoff is the rationale for this performance improvement. Performance is validated on simulated and real data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,DEC,2015,16,,,,,,3183,3217,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000369888000028,0

If otherwise, it is called singular. In regular statistical models, the Bayes free energy, which is defined by the minus logarithm of Bayes marginal likelihood, can be asymptotically approximated by the Schwarz Bayes information criterion (BIC), whereas in singular models such approximation does not hold. Recently, it was proved that the Bayes free energy of a singular model is asymptotically given by a generalized formula using a birational invariant, the real log canonical threshold (RLCT), instead of half the number of parameters in BIC. Theoretical values of RLCTs in several statistical models are now being discovered based on algebraic geometrical methodology. However, it has been difficult to estimate the Bayes free energy using only training samples, because an RLCT depends on an unknown true distribution. In the present paper, we define a widely applicable Bayesian information criterion (WBIC) by the average log likelihood function over the posterior distribution with the inverse temperature 1/logn, where n is the number of training samples. We mathematically prove that WBIC has the same asymptotic expansion as the Bayes free energy, even if a statistical model is singular for or unrealizable by a statistical model.

As the model is updated, the goal of adaptive inference is to take advantage of previously computed quantities to perform inference more rapidly than from scratch. In this paper, we present algorithms for adaptive exact inference on general graphs that can be used to efficiently compute marginals and update MAP configurations under arbitrary changes to the input factor graph and its associated elimination tree. After a linear time preprocessing step, our approach enables updates to the model and the computation of any marginal in time that is logarithmic in the size of the input model. Moreover, in contrast to max-product our approach can also be used to update MAP configurations in time that is roughly proportional to the number of updated entries, rather than the size of the input model. To evaluate the practical effectiveness of our algorithms, we implement and test them using synthetic data as well as for two real-world computational biology applications.

An S-function is specifically defined as the dot product between the images of two objects in a Hilbert space mapped from two different input spaces. One advantage of taking this view is that one can take a unified and principled approach to address the issues with regard to search relevance. The paper then proposes employing a kernel method to learn a robust relevance model as an S-function, which can effectively deal with the term mismatch problem, one of the biggest challenges in search. The kernel method exploits a positive semi-definite kernel referred to as an S-kernel. The paper shows that when using an S-kernel the model learned by the kernel method is guaranteed to be an S-function. The paper then gives more general principles for constructing S-kernels. A specific implementation of the kernel method is proposed using the Ranking SVM techniques and click-through data.

Following the manifold regularization approach, Laplacian Support Vector Machines (LapSVMs) have shown the state of the art performance in semi-supervised classification. In this paper we present two strategies to solve the primal LapSVM problem, in order to overcome some issues of the original dual formulation. In particular, training a LapSVM in the primal can be efficiently performed with preconditioned conjugate gradient. We speed up training by using an early stopping strategy based on the prediction on unlabeled data or, if available, on labeled validation examples. This allows the algorithm to quickly compute approximate solutions with roughly the same classification accuracy as the optimal ones, considerably reducing the training time. The computational complexity of the training algorithm is reduced from O(n(3)) to O(kn(2)), where n is the combined number of labeled and unlabeled examples and k is empirically evaluated to be significantly smaller than n. Due to its simplicity, training LapSVM in the primal can be the starting point for additional enhancements of the original LapSVM formulation, such as those for dealing with large data sets.

Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a classical statistical approach for supervised dimensionality reduction. It aims to maximize the ratio of the between-class distance to the within-class distance, thus maximizing the class discrimination. It has been used widely in many applications. However, the classical LDA formulation requires the nonsingularity of the scatter matrices involved. For undersampled problems, where the data dimensionality is much larger than the sample size, all scatter matrices are singular and classical LDA fails. Many extensions, including null space LDA (NLDA) and orthogonal LDA (OLDA), have been proposed in the past to overcome this problem. NLDA aims to maximize the between-class distance in the null space of the within-class scatter matrix, while OLDA computes a set of orthogonal discriminant vectors via the simultaneous diagonalization of the scatter matrices. They have been applied successfully in various applications. In this paper, we present a computational and theoretical analysis of NLDA and OLDA. Our main result shows that under a mild condition which holds in many applications involving high-dimensional data, NLDA is equivalent to OLDA. We have performed extensive experiments on various types of data and results are consistent with our theoretical analysis. We further apply the regularization to OLDA.

Although single-graph analysis is well-studied, multiple graph inference is largely unexplored, in part because of the challenges inherent in appropriately modeling graph differences and yet retaining sufficient model simplicity to render estimation feasible. This paper addresses exactly this gap, by introducing a new model, the common subspace independent-edge multiple random graph model, which describes a heterogeneous collection of networks with a shared latent structure on the vertices but potentially different connectivity patterns for each graph. The model encompasses many popular network representations, including the stochastic blockmodel. The model is both flexible enough to meaningfully account for important graph differences, and tractable enough to allow for accurate inference in multiple networks. In particular, a joint spectral embedding of adjacency matrices-the multiple adjacency spectral embedding-leads to simultaneous consistent estimation of underlying parameters for each graph. Under mild additional assumptions, the estimates satisfy asymptotic normality and yield improvements for graph eigen-value estimation. In both simulated and real data, the model and the embedding can be deployed for a number of subsequent network inference tasks, including dimensionality reduction, classification, hypothesis testing, and community detection. Specifically, when the embedding is applied to a data set of connectomes constructed through diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, the result is an accurate classification of brain scans by human subject and a meaningful determination of heterogeneity across scans of different individuals.",,,,,,"Cape, Joshua/0000-0002-1471-1650",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2021,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,34650343,,,,,WOS:000700318200001,0

This has led to the birth of many iterative algorithms to solve them. A powerful strategy to boost the performance of these algorithms is known as safe screening: it allows the early identification of zero coordinates in the solution, which can then be eliminated to reduce the problem's size and accelerate convergence. In this work, we extend the existing Gap Safe screening framework by relaxing the global strong-concavity assumption on the dual cost function. Instead, we exploit local regularity properties, that is, strong concavity on well-chosen subsets of the domain. The non-negativity constraint is also integrated to the existing framework. Besides making safe screening possible to a broader class of functions that includes beta-divergences (e.g., the Kullback-Leibler divergence), the proposed approach also improves upon the existing Gap Safe screening rules on previously applicable cases (e.g., logistic regression). The proposed general framework is exemplified by some notable particular cases: logistic function, beta = 1.5 and Kullback-Leibler divergences. Finally, we showcase the effectiveness of the proposed screening rules with different solvers (coordinate descent, multiplicative-update and proximal gradient algorithms) and different data sets (binary classification, hyperspectral and count data).",,,,,"Soubies, Emmanuel/HGA-2611-2022","Soubies, Emmanuel/0000-0003-0571-6983",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2021,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000706880000001,0

To combine this expressive power with computational efficiency numerous randomized schemes have been proposed in the literature, among which probably random Fourier features (RFF) are the simplest and most popular. While RFFs were originally designed for the approximation of kernel values, recently they have been adapted to kernel derivatives, and hence to the solution of large-scale tasks involving function derivatives. Unfortunately, the understanding of the RFF scheme for the approximation of higher-order kernel derivatives is quite limited due to the challenging polynomial growing nature of the underlying function class in the empirical process. To tackle this difficulty, we establish a finite-sample deviation bound for a general class of polynomial-growth functions under alpha-exponential Orlicz condition on the distribution of the sample. Instantiating this result for RFFs, our finite-sample uniform guarantee implies a.s. convergence with tight rate for arbitrary kernel with alpha-exponential Orlicz spectrum and any order of derivative.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2020,21,,,,,,,,145,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000558805800001,0

An ideal set of kernels should: admit a linear parameterization (tractability); be dense in the set of all kernels (accuracy); and every member should be universal so that the hypothesis space is infinite-dimensional (scalability). Currently, there is no class of kernel that meets all three criteria - e.g. Gaussians are not tractable or accurate; polynomials are not scalable. We propose a new class that meet all three criteria - the Tessellated Kernel (TK) class. Specifically, the TK class: admits a linear parameterization using positive matrices; is dense in all kernels; and every element in the class is universal. This implies that the use of TK kernels for learning the kernel can obviate the need for selecting candidate kernels in algorithms such as SimpleMKL and parameters such as the bandwidth. Numerical testing on soft margin Support Vector Machine (SVM) problems show that algorithms using TK kernels outperform other kernel learning algorithms and neural networks. Furthermore, our results show that when the ratio of the number of training data to features is high, the improvement of TK over MKL increases significantly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2020,21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000520962000020,0

Drug resistance can emerge from random and variable mutations in targeted cell populations; in the absence of an appropriate dosing policy, emergent resistant subpopulations can proliferate and lead to treatment failure. Dynamic feedback dosage control holds promise in combatting this phenomenon, but the application of traditional control approaches to such systems is fraught with challenges due to the complexity of cell dynamics, uncertainty in model parameters, and the need in medical applications for a robust controller that can be trusted to properly handle unexpected outcomes. Here, training on a sample biological scenario identified single-drug and combination therapy policies that exhibit a 100% success rate at suppressing cell proliferation and responding to diverse system perturbations while establishing low-dose no-event baselines.

The objective of this paper is to compare the computationally-heavy GL technique with a numerically-cheap heuristic method that is based on simply thresholding the sample covariance matrix. To this end, two notions of sign-consistent and inverse-consistent matrices are developed, and then it is shown that the thresholding and GL methods are equivalent if: (i) the thresholded sample covariance matrix is both sign-consistent and inverse-consistent, and (ii) the gap between the largest thresholded and the smallest un-thresholded entries of the sample covariance matrix is not too small. By building upon this result, it is proved that the GL method-as a conic optimization problem-has an explicit closed-form solution if the thresholded sample covariance matrix has an acyclic structure. This result is then generalized to arbitrary sparse support graphs, where a formula is found to obtain an approximate solution of GL. Furthermore, it is shown that the approximation error of the derived explicit formula decreases exponentially fast with respect to the length of the minimum-length cycle of the sparsity graph.

The data is generated by an unknown probability distribution over the space of all one-way infinite sequences. Two settings are considered: the realizable and the non-realizable one. Assume first that the probability measure generating the sequence belongs to a given set C (realizable case), but the latter is completely arbitrary (uncountably infinite, without any structure given). It is shown that the minimax asymptotic average loss-which may be positive-is always attainable, and it is attained by a Bayesian predictor whose prior is discrete and concentrated on C. Moreover, the finite-time loss of the Bayesian predictor is also optimal up to an additive log n term (where n is the time step). This upper bound is complemented by a lower bound that goes to infinity but may do so arbitrarily slow. Passing to the non-realizable setting, let the probability measure generating the data be arbitrary, and consider the given set C as a set of experts to compete with. The goal is to minimize the regret with respect to the experts. It is shown that in this setting it is possible that all Bayesian strategies are strictly suboptimal even asymptotically. In other words, a sublinear regret may be attainable but the regret of every Bayesian predictor is linear. A very general recommendation for choosing a model can be made based on these results: it is better to take a model large enough to make sure it includes the process that generates the data, even if it entails positive asymptotic average loss, for otherwise any combination of predictors in the model class may be useless.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2019,20,,,,,,,,149,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000491132200013,0

This implies that, at least from a statistical perspective, explicit regularization is not required in order to compensate for ill-conditioned data, which stands in contrast to a widely common approach that includes a regularization for analyzing the sample complexity of generalized linear models. Several important implications of our findings include: a) We demonstrate that the excess risk of empirical risk minimization (ERM) is controlled by the preconditioned stability rate.

First, we observe a remarkable global convergence behavior of the algorithm's iterates to the low-rank matrix for relevant, interesting cases, for which any other state-of-the-art optimization approach fails the recovery. Secondly, HM-IRLS exhibits an empirical recovery probability close to 1 even for a number of measurements very close to the theoretical lower bound r(d(1)+d(2)-r), i.e., already for significantly fewer linear observations than any other tractable approach in the literature.

Although elegant, the application of GPs is limited by computational and analytical intractabilities that arise when data are su ffi ciently numerous or when employing non-Gaussian models. Consequently, a wealth of GP approximation schemes have been developed over the last 15 years to address these key limitations. Many of these schemes employ a small set of pseudo data points to summarise the actual data. In this paper we develop a new pseudo-point approximation framework using Power Expectation Propagation (Power EP) that uni fi es a large number of these pseudo-point approximations. Unlike much of the previous venerable work in this area, the new framework is built on standard methods for approximate inference (variational free-energy, EP and Power EP methods) rather than employing approximations to the probabilistic generative model itself.

Spectral methods propose elegant solutions to the problem of inferring weighted automata from finite samples of variable-length strings drawn from an unknown target distribution p. These methods rely on a singular value decomposition of a matrix H-S, called the empirical Hankel matrix, that records the frequencies of (some of) the observed strings S. The accuracy of the learned distribution depends both on the quantity of information embedded in H-S and on the distance between H-S and its mean H-p. Existing concentration bounds seem to indicate that the concentration over H-p gets looser with its dimensions, suggesting that it might be necessary to bound the dimensions of H-S for learning. We prove new dimension-free concentration bounds for classical Hankel matrices and several variants, based on prefixes or factors of strings, that are useful for learning. Experiments demonstrate that these bounds are tight and that they significantly improve existing (dimension-dependent) bounds.

A valid instrumental variable is a variable that is independent of unmeasured confounders and affects the treatment but does not have a direct effect on the outcome beyond its effect on the treatment. Two commonly used estimators for using an instrumental variable to estimate a treatment effect are the two stage least squares estimator and the control function estimator. For linear causal effect models, these two estimators are equivalent, but for nonlinear causal effect models, the estimators are different. We provide a systematic comparison of these two estimators for nonlinear causal effect models and develop an approach to combing the two estimators that generally performs better than either one alone. We show that the control function estimator is a two stage least squares estimator with an augmented set of instrumental variables. If these augmented instrumental variables are valid, then the control function estimator can be much more efficient than usual two stage least squares without the augmented instrumental variables while if the augmented instrumental variables are not valid, then the control function estimator may be inconsistent while the usual two stage least squares remains consistent.

When viewed in the right parameterization, this compression loss is linear, i.e. it can be rewritten as tr(W(t)x(t)x(t)(inverted perpendicular)), where W-t is the parameter of the algorithm and the outer product x(t)x(t)(inverted perpendicular) (with parallel to x(t)parallel to <= 1) is the instance matrix. In this paper generalize PCA to arbitrary positive definite instance matrices X-t with the linear loss tr(WtXt). We evaluate online algorithms in terms of their worst-case regret, which is a bound on the additional total loss of the online algorithm on all instances matrices over the compression loss of the best k-dimensional subspace (chosen in hindsight). We focus on two popular online algorithms for generalized PCA: the Gradient Descent (GD) and Matrix Exponentiated Gradient (MEG) algorithms. We show that if the regret is expressed as a function of the number of trials, then both algorithms are optimal to within a constant factor on worst-case sequences of positive definite instances matrices with trace norm at most one (which subsumes the original PCA problem with outer products). This is surprising because MEG is believed be suboptimal in this case. We also show that when considering regret bounds as a function of a loss budget, then MEG remains optimal and strictly outperforms GD when the instance matrices are trace norm bounded. Next, we consider online PCA when the adversary is allowed to present the algorithm with positive semide finite instance matrices whose largest eigenvalue is bounded (rather than their trace which is the sum of their eigenvalues).

The ETD(lambda) algorithm was recently proposed by Sutton, Mahmood, and White (2016) to solve a long-standing divergence problem of the standard TD algorithm when it is applied to off-policy training, where data from an exploratory policy are used to evaluate other policies of interest. The almost sure convergence of ETD(lambda) has been proved in our recent work under general off-policy training conditions, but for a narrow range of diminishing stepsize. In this paper we present convergence results for constrained versions of ETD(lambda) with constant stepsize and with diminishing stepsize from a broad range. Our results characterize the asymptotic behavior of the trajectory of iterates produced by those algorithms, and are derived by combining key properties of ETD(lambda) with powerful convergence theorems from the weak convergence methods in stochastic approximation theory. For the case of constant stepsize, in addition to analyzing the behavior of the algorithms in the limit as the stepsize parameter approaches zero, we also analyze their behavior for a fixed stepsize and bound the deviations of their averaged iterates from the desired solution. These results are obtained by exploiting the weak Feller property of the Markov chains associated with the algorithms, and by using ergodic theorems for weak Feller Markov chains, in conjunction with the convergence results we get from the weak convergence methods. Besides ETD(lambda), our analysis also applies to the off-policy TD(lambda) algorithm, when the divergence issue is avoided by setting lambda sufficiently large.

Blackwell provided two equivalent conditions for a convex set to be approachable. Standard approachability algorithms rely on the primal condition, which is a geometric separation condition, and essentially require to compute at each stage a projection direction from a certain point to S.

A dominant theoretical and algorithmic framework for the problem has been to reduce bipartite ranking to pairwise classification; in particular, it is well known that the bipartite ranking regret can be formulated as a pairwise classification regret, which in turn can be upper bounded using usual regret bounds for classification problems. Recently, Kotlowski et al. (2011) showed regret bounds for bipartite ranking in terms of the regret associated with balanced versions of the standard (non-pairwise) logistic and exponential losses. In this paper, we show that such (non-pairwise) surrogate regret bounds for bipartite ranking can be obtained in terms of a broad class of proper (composite) losses that we term as strongly proper. Our proof technique is much simpler than that of Kotlowski et al. (2011), and relies on properties of proper (composite) losses as elucidated recently by Reid and Williamson (2010, 2011) and others. Our result yields explicit surrogate bounds (with no hidden balancing terms) in terms of a variety of strongly proper losses, including for example logistic, exponential, squared and squared hinge losses as special cases. An important consequence is that standard algorithms minimizing a (non-pairwise) strongly proper loss, such as logistic regression and boosting algorithms (assuming a universal function class and appropriate regularization), are in fact consistent for bipartite ranking; moreover, our results allow us to quantify the bipartite ranking regret in terms of the corresponding surrogate regret. We also obtain tighter surrogate bounds under certain low-noise conditions via a recent result of Clemencon and Robbiano (2011).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,MAY,2014,15,,,,,,1653,1674,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000344638100002,0

While tensor computing is widely used in computer vision, the geometry of tensor space is often ignored. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the importance of the intrinsic geometry of tensor space which yields a very discriminating structure for action recognition. We characterize data tensors as points on a product manifold and model it statistically using least squares regression. To this aim, we factorize a data tensor relating to each order of the tensor using Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) and then impose each factorized element on a Grassmann manifold. Furthermore, we account for underlying geometry on manifolds and formulate least squares regression as a composite function. This gives a natural extension from Euclidean space to manifolds. Consequently, classification is performed using geodesic distance on a product manifold where each factor manifold is Grassmannian. Our method exploits appearance and motion without explicitly modeling the shapes and dynamics. We assess the proposed method using three gesture databases, namely the Cambridge hand-gesture, the UMD Keck body-gesture, and the CHALEARN gesture challenge data sets.

These metrics include accuracy, unweighted accuracy, the area under the ROC curve or the ROC convex hull, the mean absolute error and the Brier score or mean squared error (with its decomposition into refinement and calibration). One way of understanding the relations among these metrics is by means of variable operating conditions (in the form of misclassification costs and/or class distributions). Thus, a metric may correspond to some expected loss over different operating conditions. One dimension for the analysis has been the distribution for this range of operating conditions, leading to some important connections in the area of proper scoring rules. We demonstrate in this paper that there is an equally important dimension which has so far received much less attention in the analysis of performance metrics. This dimension is given by the decision rule, which is typically implemented as a threshold choice method when using scoring models. In this paper, we explore many old and new threshold choice methods: fixed, score-uniform, score-driven, rate-driven and optimal, among others. By calculating the expected loss obtained with these threshold choice methods for a uniform range of operating conditions we give clear interpretations of the 0-1 loss, the absolute error, the Brier score, the AUC and the refinement loss respectively. Our analysis provides a comprehensive view of performance metrics as well as a systematic approach to loss minimisation which can be summarised as follows: given a model, apply the threshold choice methods that correspond with the available information about the operating condition, and compare their expected losses. In order to assist in this procedure we also derive several connections between the aforementioned performance metrics, and we highlight the role of calibration in choosing the threshold choice method.",,,,,"Hernandez-Orallo, Jose/H-9166-2015; Ramírez, Cesar Ferri/H-9181-2015","Hernandez-Orallo, Jose/0000-0001-9746-7632; Ramírez, Cesar Ferri/0000-0002-8975-1120; Flach, Peter/0000-0001-6857-5810",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,OCT,2012,13,,,,,,2813,2869,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000313200000001,0

Despite its use in conventional statistical models, the assumption of instance independence is contradicted by most relational data sets. For example, in citation data there are dependencies among the topics of a paper's references, and in genomic data there are dependencies among the functions of interacting proteins. In this paper, we present relational dependency networks ( RDNs), graphical models that are capable of expressing and reasoning with such dependencies in a relational setting. We discuss RDNs in the context of relational Bayes networks and relational Markov networks and outline the relative strengths of RDNs-namely, the ability to represent cyclic dependencies, simple methods for parameter estimation, and efficient structure learning techniques. The strengths of RDNs are due to the use of pseudolikelihood learning techniques, which estimate an efficient approximation of the full joint distribution. We present learned RDNs for a number of real-world data sets and evaluate the models in a prediction context, showing that RDNs identify and exploit cyclic relational dependencies to achieve significant performance gains over conventional conditional models. In addition, we use synthetic data to explore model performance under various relational data characteristics, showing that RDN learning and inference techniques are accurate over a wide range of conditions.",,,,,,"Jensen, David/0000-0001-5653-3349",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,MAR,2007,8,,,,,,653,692,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000247002700010,0

A widely used approach is to assume that the available data constitute a random sample from a multivariate distribution belonging to a Gaussian graphical model. As a consequence, the prime objects of inference are full-order partial correlations which are partial correlations between two variables given the remaining ones. In the context of microarray data the number of variables exceed the sample size and this precludes the application of traditional structure learning procedures because a sampling version of full-order partial correlations does not exist. In this paper we consider limited-order partial correlations, these are partial correlations computed on marginal distributions of manageable size, and provide a set of rules that allow one to assess the usefulness of these quantities to derive the independence structure of the underlying Gaussian graphical model. Furthermore, we introduce a novel structure learning procedure based on a quantity, obtained from limited-order partial correlations, that we call the non-rejection rate.

An SVM is associated with each cell in a recursive partitioning of the space of patterns (hypotheses) into increasingly finer subsets. The hierarchy is traversed coarse-to-fine and each chain of positive responses from the root to a leaf constitutes a detection. Our objective is to design and build a network which balances overall error and computation. Initially, SVMs are constructed for each cell with no constraints. This free network is then perturbed, cell by cell, into another network, which is graded in two ways: first, the number of support vectors of each SVM is reduced (by clustering) in order to adjust to a pre-determined, increasing function of cell depth; second, the decision boundaries are shifted to preserve all positive responses from the original set of training data. The limits on the numbers of clusters (virtual support vectors) result from minimizing the mean computational cost of collecting all detections subject to a bound on the expected number of false positives. When applied to detecting faces in cluttered scenes, the patterns correspond to poses and the free network is already faster and more accurate than applying a single pose-specific SVM many times.

Recently some work has been done where the predictor ut at each trial t is allowed to change with time, and the total on-line loss of the algorithm is compared to the sum of the losses of ut at each trial plus the total cost for shifting to successive predictors. This is to model situations in which the examples change over time, and different predictors from the comparison class are best for different segments of the sequence of examples. We call such bounds shifting bounds. They hold for arbitrary sequences of examples and arbitrary sequences of predictors. Naturally shifting bounds are much harder to prove. The only known bounds are for the case when the comparison class consists of a sequences of experts or boolean disjunctions. In this paper we develop the methodology for lifting known static bounds to the shifting case. In particular we obtain bounds when the comparison class consists of linear neurons (linear combinations of experts).

We employ model assisted clustering, in which the clusters contain features that are similar to the same unobserved latent variable. Two different cluster-based Gaussian graphical models are considered: the latent variable graph, corresponding to the graphical model associated with the unobserved latent variables, and the cluster-average graph, corresponding to the vector of features averaged over clusters. Our study reveals that likelihood based inference for the latent graph, not analyzed previously, is analytically intractable. Our main contribution is the development and analysis of alternative estimation and inference strategies, for the precision matrix of an unobservable latent vector Z. We replace the likelihood of the data by an appropriate class of empirical risk functions, that can be specialized to the latent graphical model and to the simpler, but under-analyzed, cluster-average graphical model. The estimators thus derived can be used for inference on the graph structure, for instance on edge strength or pattern recovery. Inference is based on the asymptotic limits of the entry-wise estimates of the precision matrices associated with the conditional independence graphs under consideration. While taking the uncertainty induced by the clustering step into account, we establish Berry-Esseen central limit theorems for the proposed estimators. It is noteworthy that, although the clusters are estimated adaptively from the data, the central limit theorems regarding the entries of the estimated graphs are proved under the same conditions one would use if the clusters were known in advance. As an illustration of the usage of these newly developed inferential tools, we show that they can be reliably used for recovery of the sparsity pattern of the graphs we study, under FDR control, which is verified via simulation studies and an fMRI data analysis.

Under the standard assumptions of convexity, Lipschitz continuity, and smoothness, we establish statistical learning rates that retain, up to logarithmic terms, single-machine serial statistical guarantees through implicit regularisation (step size tuning and early stopping) with appropriate dependence on the graph topology. Our approach avoids the need for explicit regularisation in decentralised learning problems, such as adding constraints to the empirical risk minimisation rule. Particularly for distributed methods, the use of implicit regularisation allows the algorithm to remain simple, without projections or dual methods. To prove our results, we establish graph-independent generalisation bounds for Distributed SGD that match the single-machine serial SGD setting (using algorithmic stability), and we establish graph-dependent optimisation bounds that are of independent interest. We present numerical experiments to show that the qualitative nature of the upper bounds we derive can be representative of real behaviours.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2020,21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000520962000009,0

Ideally, adjustment sets are selected based on a given causal graph, reflecting knowledge of the underlying causal structure. Valid adjustment sets are, however, not unique. Recent research has introduced a graphical criterion for an 'optimal' valid adjustment set (O-set). For a given graph, adjustment by the O-set yields the smallest asymptotic variance compared to other adjustment sets in certain parametric and non-parametric models. In this paper, we provide three new results on the O-set. First, we give a novel, more intuitive graphical characterisation: We show that the O-set is the parent set of the outcome node(s) in a suitable latent projection graph, which we call the forbidden projection. An important property is that the forbidden projection preserves all information relevant to total causal effect estimation via covariate adjustment, making it a useful methodological tool in its own right. Second, we extend the existing IDA algorithm to use the O-set, and argue that the algorithm remains semi-local. This is implemented in the R-package pcalg.

Unfortunately, this tuning is often a black art requiring expert experience or brute-force search. It is therefore tempting to develop tuning-free algorithms that can determine the sparsity of the graph adaptively from the observed data in an automatic fashion. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, named BISN (Bayesian inference of Sparse Networks), for automatic Gaussian graphical model selection. Specifically, we regard the off-diagonal entries in the precision matrix as random variables and impose sparse-promoting horseshoe priors on them, resulting in automatic sparsity determination. With the help of stochastic gradients, an efficient variational Bayes algorithm is derived to learn the model. We further propose a decaying recursive stochastic gradient (DRSG) method to reduce the variance of the stochastic gradients and to accelerate the convergence. Our theoretical analysis shows that the time complexity of BISN scales only quadratically with the dimension, whereas the theoretical time complexity of the state-of-the-art methods for automatic graphical model selection is typically a third-order function of the dimension. Furthermore, numerical results show that BISN can achieve comparable or better performance than the state-of-the-art methods in terms of structure recovery, and yet its computational time is several orders of magnitude shorter, especially for large dimensions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2020,21,,,,,,,,124,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000556192100001,0

An SSTS is a set of events and a set of scalars. An event is defined by a symbol and a time-stamp. A scalar is defined by a symbol and a function mapping a number for each possible time stamp of the data. The proposed algorithms rely on temporal patterns called Graph of Temporal Constraints (GTC). A GTC is a directed graph in which vertices express occurrences of specific events, and edges express temporal constraints between occurrences of pairs of events. Additionally, each vertex of a GTC can be augmented with numeric constraints on scalar values. We allow GTCs to be cyclic and/or disconnected.

Approaches using sparsity-inducing penalty functions such as the Lasso can be useful for producing interpretable models. However, when the number variables runs into the thousands, and so even two-way interactions number in the millions, these methods may become computationally infeasible. Typically variable screening based on model fits using only main effects must be performed first. One problem with screening is that important variables may be missed if they are only useful for prediction when certain interaction terms are also present in the model. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new method we call Backtracking. It can be incorporated into many existing high-dimensional methods based on penalty functions, and works by building increasing sets of candidate interactions iteratively. Models fitted on the main effects and interactions selected early on in this process guide the selection of future interactions. By also making use of previous fits for computation, as well as performing calculations is parallel, the overall run-time of the algorithm can be greatly reduced.

However, slow running or straggler tasks can run up to 8 times slower than the median task on a production cluster (Ananthanarayanan et al., 2013), leading to delayed job completion and inefficient use of resources. Existing straggler mitigation techniques wait to detect stragglers and then relaunch them, delaying straggler detection and wasting resources. We built Wrangler (Yadwadkar et al., 2014), a system that predicts when stragglers are going to occur and makes scheduling decisions to avoid such situations. To capture node and workload variability, Wrangler built separate models for every node and workload, requiring the time-consuming collection of substantial training data.

Unlike naive multi-task learning formulations, our formulations capture the shared structure in our data, improving generalization performance on limited data.

We establish both estimation and selection consistency of the proposed estimator in the high dimensional setting.

The crowdsourcing workers or annotators are paid for each label they provide, but the task requester usually has only a limited amount of the budget. Since the data instances have different levels of labeling difficulty and the workers have different reliability for the labeling task, it is desirable to wisely allocate the budget among all the instances and workers such that the overall labeling quality is maximized. In this paper, we formulate the budget allocation problem as a Bayesian Markov decision process (MDP), which simultaneously conducts learning and decision making. The optimal allocation policy can be obtained by using the dynamic programming (DP) recurrence. However, DP quickly becomes computationally intractable when the size of the problem increases. To solve this challenge, we propose a computationally efficient approximate policy which is called optimistic knowledge gradient. Our method applies to both pull crowdsourcing marketplaces with homogeneous workers and push marketplaces with heterogeneous workers. It can also incorporate the contextual information of instances when they are available. The experiments on both simulated and real data show that our policy achieves a higher labeling quality than other existing policies at the same budget level.",,,,,", Gustavo/ABC-1706-2022; Camps-Valls, Gustavo/A-2532-2011","Camps-Valls, Gustavo/0000-0003-1683-2138",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,JAN,2015,16,,,,,,1,46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000369885500001,0
J,"Wipf, D; Zhang, HC",,,,"Wipf, David; Zhang, Haichao",,,Revisiting Bayesian Blind Deconvolution,JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,"Blind deconvolution involves the estimation of a sharp signal or image given only a blurry observation. Because this problem is fundamentally ill-posed, strong priors on both the sharp image and blur kernel are required to regularize the solution space. While this naturally leads to a standard MAP estimation framework, performance is compromised by unknown trade-off parameter settings, optimization heuristics, and convergence issues stemming from non-convexity and/or poor prior selections. To mitigate some of these problems, a number of authors have recently proposed substituting a variational Bayesian (VB) strategy that marginalizes over the high-dimensional image space leading to better estimates of the blur kernel. However, the underlying cost function now involves both integrals with no closed-form solution and complex, function-valued arguments, thus losing the transparency of MAP. Beyond standard Bayesian-inspired intuitions, it thus remains unclear by exactly what mechanism these methods are able to operate, rendering understanding, improvements and extensions more difficult. To elucidate these issues, we demonstrate that the VB methodology can be recast as an unconventional MAP problem with a very particular penalty/prior that conjoins the image, blur kernel, and noise level in a principled way. This unique penalty has a number of useful characteristics pertaining to relative concavity, local minima avoidance, normalization, and scale-invariance that allow us to rigorously explain the success of VB including its existing implementational heuristics and approximations. It also provides strict criteria for learning the noise level and choosing the optimal image prior that, perhaps counter-intuitively, need not reflect the statistics of natural scenes. In so doing we challenge the prevailing notion of why VB is successful for blind deconvolution while providing a transparent platform for introducing enhancements and extensions. Moreover, the underlying insights carry over to a wide variety of other bilinear models common in the machine learning literature such as independent component analysis, dictionary learning/sparse coding, and non-negative matrix factorization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,NOV,2014,15,,,,,,3595,3634,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000353126200009,0

In practice, these algorithms are feasible to networks of at most around 30 nodes, mainly due to the large space requirement. Here, we generalize the dynamic programming approach to enhance its feasibility in three dimensions: first, the user may trade space against time; second, the proposed algorithms easily and efficiently parallelize onto thousands of processors; third, the algorithms can exploit any prior knowledge about the precedence relation on the nodes. Underlying all these results is the key observation that, given a partial order P on the nodes, an optimal DAG compatible with P can be found in time and space roughly proportional to the number of ideals of P, which can be significantly less than 2(n). Considering sufficiently many carefully chosen partial orders guarantees that a globally optimal DAG will be found.

The MMD can be computed in quadratic time, although efficient linear time approximations are available. Our statistic is an instance of an integral probability metric, and various classical metrics on distributions are obtained when alternative function classes are used in place of an RKHS. We apply our two-sample tests to a variety of problems, including attribute matching for databases using the Hungarian marriage method, where they perform strongly. Excellent performance is also obtained when comparing distributions over graphs, for which these are the first such tests.",,,,,"Schölkopf, Bernhard/A-7570-2013","Schölkopf, Bernhard/0000-0002-8177-0925; Gretton, Arthur/0000-0003-3169-7624; Borgwardt, Karsten/0000-0001-7221-2393",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,MAR,2012,13,,,,,,723,773,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000303772100009,0

One class of statistical models which has recently gained increasing popularity and has been applied to a variety of complex data is formed by deep belief networks. Analyses of these models, however, have often been limited to qualitative analyses based on samples due to the computationally intractable nature of their likelihood. Motivated by these circumstances, the present article introduces a consistent estimator for the likelihood of deep belief networks which is computationally tractable and simple to apply in practice.

In this paper, we consider the problem of optimizing a kernel function over the class of translation invariant kernels for the task of binary classification. The learning capacity of this class is invariant with respect to rotation and scaling of the features and it encompasses the set of radial kernels. We show that how translation invariant kernel functions can be embedded in a nested set of sub-classes and consider the kernel learning problem over one of these sub-classes. This allows the choice of an appropriate sub-class based on the problem at hand. We use the criterion proposed by Lanckriet et al. (2004) to obtain a functional formulation for the problem. It will be proven that the optimal kernel is a finite mixture of cosine functions. The kernel learning problem is then formulated as a semi-infinite programming (SIP) problem which is solved by a sequence of quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) sub-problems. Using the fact that the cosine kernel is of rank two, we propose a formulation of a QCQP sub-problem which does not require the kernel matrices to be loaded into memory, making the method applicable to large-scale problems. We also address the issue of including other classes of kernels, such as individual kernels and isotropic Gaussian kernels, in the learning process. Another interesting feature of the proposed method is that the optimal classifier has an expansion in terms of the number of cosine kernels, instead of support vectors, leading to a remarkable speedup at run-time. As a by-product, we also generalize the kernel trick to complex-valued kernel functions.

However, a recent empirical study has shown that a hybrid algorithm improves sensitively accuracy and speed: it learns a skeleton with an independency test (IT) approach and constrains on the directed acyclic graphs (DAG) considered during the search-and-score phase. Subsequently, we theorize the structural constraint by introducing the concept of super-structure S, which is an undirected graph that restricts the search to networks whose skeleton is a subgraph of S. We develop a super-structure constrained optimal search (COS): its time complexity is upper bounded by O(gamma(n)(m)), where gamma(m) < 2 depends on the maximal degree m of S. Empirically, complexity depends on the average degree <(m)over tilde> and sparse structures allow larger graphs to be calculated. Our algorithm is faster than an optimal search by several orders and even finds more accurate results when given a sound super-structure. Practically, S can be approximated by IT approaches; significance level of the tests controls its sparseness, enabling to control the trade-off between speed and accuracy.

We present a new model, referred to as the Greedy Additive Regression (GAR) model, for learning a library of torque sequences, and for learning the coefficients of a linear combination of sequences minimizing a cost function. From the perspective of numerical optimization, the GAR model is interesting because it creates a library of local features-each sequence in the library is a solution to a single training task-and learns to combine these sequences using a local optimization procedure, namely, additive regression. We speculate that learners with local representational primitives and local optimization procedures will show good performance on nonlinear tasks. The GAR model is also interesting from the perspective of motor control because it outperforms several competing models. Results using a simulated two-joint arm suggest that the GAR model consistently shows excellent performance in the sense that it rapidly learns to perform novel, complex motor tasks. Moreover, its library is overcomplete and sparse, meaning that only a small fraction of the stored torque sequences are used when learning a new movement. The library is also robust in the sense that, after an initial training period, nearly all novel movements can be learned as additive combinations of sequences in the library, and in the sense that it shows good generalization when an arm's dynamics are altered between training and test conditions, such as when a payload is added to the arm. Lastly, the GAR model works well regardless of whether motor tasks are specified in joint space or Cartesian space. We conclude that learning techniques using local primitives and optimization procedures are viable and potentially important methods for motor control and possibly other domains, and that these techniques deserve further examination by the artificial intelligence and cognitive science communities.",,,,,"Jacobs, Robert/B-7670-2013","Jacobs, Robert/0000-0001-6607-908X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,JUL,2008,9,,,,,,1535,1558,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000258646800008,0

Estimating parameters using the Maximum Likelihood approach is feasible only for a subclass of max-sum classifiers with an acyclic structure of neighbouring pairs. Recently, the discriminative methods represented by the perceptron and the Support Vector Machines, originally designed for binary linear classifiers, have been extended for learning some subclasses of the max-sum classifier. Besides the max-sum classifiers with the acyclic neighbouring structure, it has been shown that the discriminative learning is possible even with arbitrary neighbouring structure provided the quality functions fulfill some additional constraints. In this article, we extend the discriminative approach to other three classes of max-sum classifiers with an arbitrary neighbourhood structure.

By adapting the methods to the special structure of SVM problems we were able to produce an efficient implementation. We conduct an extensive study of the behavior of our method and its variations on SVM problems. We present computational results comparing our method with Joachims' SVMlight (see Joachims, 1999). The results show that our method has overall better performance on many SVM problems. It seems to have a particularly strong advantage on more difficult problems. In addition this algorithm has better theoretical properties and it naturally extends to the incremental mode.

The ideal measure of independence is the mutual information and is known to be related to the entropy of the components when the search for components is restricted to uncorrelated components. This paper explores the connections between mutual information, entropy and non-Gaussianity in a larger framework, without resorting to a somewhat arbitrary decorrelation constraint. A key result is that the mutual information can be decomposed, under linear transforms, as the sum of two terms: one term expressing the decorrelation of the components and one expressing their non-Gaussianity. Our results extend the previous understanding of these connections and explain them in the light of information geometry.

This new approach is motivated by the least-squares temporal-difference learning algorithm (LSTD) for prediction problems, which is known for its efficient use of sample experiences compared to pure temporal-difference algorithms. Heretofore, LSTD has not had a straightforward application to control problems mainly because LSTD learns the state value function of a fixed policy which cannot be used for action selection and control without a model of the underlying process. Our new algorithm, least-squares policy iteration (LSPI), learns the state-action value function which allows for action selection without a model and for incremental policy improvement within a policy-iteration framework. LSPI is a model-free, off-policy method which can use efficiently (and reuse in each iteration) sample experiences collected in any manner. By separating the sample collection method, the choice of the linear approximation architecture, and the solution method, LSPI allows for focused attention on the distinct elements that contribute to practical reinforcement learning. LSPI is tested on the simple task of balancing an inverted pendulum and the harder task of balancing and riding a bicycle to a target location. In both cases, LSPI learns to control the pendulum or the bicycle by merely observing a relatively small number of trials where actions are selected randomly. LSPI is also compared against Q-learning (both with and without experience replay) using the same value function architecture. While LSPI achieves good performance fairly consistently on the difficult bicycle task, Q-learning variants were rarely able to balance for more than a small fraction of the time needed to reach the target location.",,,,,"Lagoudakis, Michail/C-5145-2008",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,Aug-15,2004,4,6,,,,,1107,1149,,10.1162/1532443041827907,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000231002600007,0

We show that the benefit of boosting arises from the ability to reweight examples to learn specific rules (resulting in high precision) combined with the ability to continue learning rules after all positive examples have been covered (resulting in high recall). As a quantitative indicator of the regularity of an extraction task, we propose a new measure that we call the SWI ratio. We show that this measure is a good predictor of IE success and a useful tool for analyzing IE tasks. Based on these results, we analyze the strengths and limitations of BWI. Specifically, we explain limitations in the information made available, and in the representations used. We also investigate the consequences of the fact that confidence values returned during extraction are not true probabilities. Next, we investigate the benefits of including grammatical and semantic information for natural text documents, as well as parse tree and attribute-value information for XML and HTML documents.

In machine learning, this subject is approached through 'multitask learning', where parallel tasks are modeled as multiple outputs of the same network. In multilevel analysis this is generally implemented through the mixed-effects linear model where a distinction is made between 'fixed effects', which are the same for all tasks, and 'random effects', which may vary between tasks. In the present article we will adopt a Bayesian approach in which some of the model parameters are shared (the same for all tasks) and others more loosely connected through a joint prior distribution that can be learned from the data. We seek in this way to combine the best parts of both the statistical multilevel approach and the neural network machinery. The standard assumption expressed in both approaches is that each task can learn equally well from any other task. In this article we extend the model by allowing more differentiation in the similarities between tasks. One such extension is to make the prior mean depend on higher-level task characteristics. More unsupervised clustering of tasks is obtained if we go from a single Gaussian prior to a mixture of Gaussians. This can be further generalized to a mixture of experts architecture with the gates depending on task characteristics.

In this paper, we propose new iterative (convex) conic quadratic relaxations that exploit not only the l(0)-norm terms, but also the fitness and smoothness functions. The iterative convexification approach substantially closes the gap between the l(0)-norm and its l(1) surrogate.

We describe a new unified class of methods, removal-based explanations, that are based on the principle of simulating feature removal to quantify each feature's influence. These methods vary in several respects, so we develop a framework that characterizes each method along three dimensions: 1) how the method removes features, 2) what model behavior the method explains, and 3) how the method summarizes each feature's influence. Our framework unifies 26 existing methods, including several of the most widely used approaches: SHAP, LIME, Meaningful Perturbations, and permutation tests. This newly understood class of explanation methods has rich connections that we examine using tools that have been largely overlooked by the explainability literature. To anchor removal-based explanations in cognitive psychology, we show that feature removal is a simple application of subtractive counterfactual reasoning. Ideas from cooperative game theory shed light on the relationships and trade-offs among different methods, and we derive conditions under which all removal-based explanations have information-theoretic interpretations. Through this analysis, we develop a unified framework that helps practitioners better understand model explanation tools, and that offers a strong theoretical foundation upon which future explainability research can build.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2021,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000706446200001,0

This is partly due to training and convention but also roots in scientists' strong interests in simple visualization and interpretability. As such, marginal feature ranking for some predictive tasks, e.g., prediction of cancer driver genes, is widely practiced in the process of scientific discoveries. In this work, we focus on marginal ranking for binary classification, one of the most common predictive tasks. We argue that the most widely used marginal ranking criteria, including the Pearson correlation, the two-sample t test, and two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test, do not fully take feature distributions and prediction objectives into account. To address this gap in practice, we propose two ranking criteria corresponding to two prediction objectives: the classical criterion (CC) and the Neyman-Pearson criterion (NPC), both of which use model-free nonparametric implementations to accommodate diverse feature distributions. Theoretically, we show that under regularity conditions, both criteria achieve sample-level ranking that is consistent with their population-level counterpart with high probability. Moreover, NPC is robust to sampling bias when the two class proportions in a sample deviate from those in the population. This property endows NPC good potential in biomedical research where sampling biases are ubiquitous. We demonstrate the use and relative advantages of CC and NPC in simulation and real data studies.

While there exists a vast literature on the interplay between infinitely wide neural networks and Gaussian processes, a little is known about analogous interplays with respect to infinitely deep neural networks. Neural networks with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) initializations exhibit undesirable forward and backward propagation properties as the number of layers increases, e.g., vanishing dependency on the input, and perfectly correlated outputs for any two inputs. To overcome these drawbacks, Peluchetti and Favaro (2020) considered fully-connected residual networks (ResNets) with network's parameters initialized by means of distributions that shrink as the number of layers increases, thus establishing an interplay between infinitely deep ResNets and solutions to stochastic differential equations, i.e. diffusion processes, and showing that infinitely deep ResNets does not suffer from undesirable forward-propagation properties. In this paper, we review the results of Peluchetti and Favaro (2020), extending them to convolutional ResNets, and we establish analogous backward-propagation results, which directly relate to the problem of training fully-connected deep ResNets. Then, we investigate the more general setting of doubly infinite neural networks, where both network's width and network's depth grow unboundedly. We focus on doubly infinite fully-connected ResNets, for which we consider i.i.d. initializations. Under this setting, we show that the dynamics of quantities of interest converge, at initialization, to deterministic limits.

However, the possible loss of the predictive performance for gaining understandability is often inevitable, especially when it needs to satisfy users with diverse backgrounds or high standards for what is considered interpretable. This tension puts practitioners in a dilemma of choosing between high accuracy (black-box models) and interpretability (interpretable models). In this work, we propose a novel framework for building a Hybrid Predictive Model that integrates an interpretable model with any pre-trained black-box model to combine their strengths. The interpretable model substitutes the black-box model on a subset of data where the interpretable model is most competent, gaining transparency at a low cost of the predictive accuracy. We design a principled objective function that considers predictive accuracy, model interpretability, and model transparency (defined as the percentage of data processed by the interpretable substitute.) Under this framework, we propose two hybrid models, one substituting with association rules and the other with linear models, and design customized training algorithms for both models. We test the hybrid models on structured data and text data where interpretable models collaborate with various state-of-the-art black-box models. Results show that hybrid models obtain an efficient trade-off between transparency and predictive performance, characterized by pareto frontiers.

We introduce and analyze a TS algorithm, which enjoys a regret bound that depends on the dimension of the linear model but not the number of items. Finally, by using information theoretic techniques and a judicious construction of cascading bandit instances, we derive a nearly-matching lower bound on the expected regret for the standard model.

RAPSA is doubly stochastic since each processor utilizes a random set of functions to compute the stochastic gradient associated with a randomly chosen sets of variable coordinates. Algorithms that are parallel in either of these dimensions exist, but RAPSA is the first attempt at a methodology that is parallel in both the selection of blocks and the selection of elements of the training set. In RAPSA, processors utilize the randomly chosen functions to compute the stochastic gradient component associated with a randomly chosen block. The technical contribution of this paper is to show that this minimally coordinated algorithm converges to the optimal classifier when the training objective is strongly convex.

In this paper we show that the same graphical criteria can be used in non-parametric causal graphical models when treatment effects are estimated using non-parametrically adjusted estimators of the interventional means. We also provide a new graphical criterion for determining the optimal adjustment set among the minimal adjustment sets and another novel graphical criterion for comparing time dependent adjustment sets. We show that uniformly optimal time dependent adjustment sets do not always exist. For point interventions, we provide a sound and complete graphical criterion for determining when a non-parametric optimally adjusted estimator of an interventional mean, or of a contrast of interventional means, is semiparametric efficient under the non-parametric causal graphical model. In addition, when the criterion is not met, we provide a sound algorithm that checks for possible simplifications of the efficient influence function of the parameter.

Proper initialization by principal component analysis is guaranteed with a simple deterministic condition. Under slightly stronger assumptions, the gradient descent method with a piecewise constant step-size scheme achieves linear convergence. The practicality of the deterministic condition is demonstrated on some statistical models of data, and the method achieves almost state-of-the-art recovery guarantees on the Haystack Model for different regimes of sample size and ambient dimension.

In particular, this work presents a sharp analysis of: (1) minibatching, a method of averaging many samples of a stochastic gradient to both reduce the variance of a stochastic gradient estimate and for parallelizing SGD and (2) tail-averaging, a method involving averaging the final few iterates of SGD in order to decrease the variance in SGD's final iterate. This work presents sharp finite sample generalization error bounds for these schemes for the stochastic approximation problem of least squares regression. Furthermore, this work establishes a precise problem-dependent extent to which mini-batching can be used to yield provable near-linear parallelization speedups over SGD with batch size one. This characterization is used to understand the relationship between learning rate versus batch size when considering the excess risk of the final iterate of an SGD procedure. Next, this mini-batching characterization is utilized in providing a highly parallelizable SGD method that achieves the minimax risk with nearly the same number of serial updates as batch gradient descent, improving significantly over existing SGD-style methods. Following this, a non-asymptotic excess risk bound for model averaging (which is a communication efficient parallelization scheme) is provided. Finally, this work sheds light on fundamental differences in SGD's behavior when dealing with mis-specified models in the non-realizable least squares problem. This paper shows that maximal stepsizes ensuring minimax risk for the mis-specified case must depend on the noise properties. The analysis tools used by this paper generalize the operator view of averaged SGD (Defossez and Bach, 2015) followed by developing a novel analysis in bounding these operators to characterize the generalization error.

In this paper we give a novel approach to the distributed training of linear classifiers (involving smooth losses and L-2 regularization) that is designed to reduce the total communication costs. At each iteration, the nodes minimize locally formed approximate objective functions; then the resulting minimizers are combined to form a descent direction to move. Our approach gives a lot of freedom in the formation of the approximate objective function as well as in the choice of methods to solve them. The method is shown to have O (log(1/epsilon)) time convergence. The method can be viewed as an iterative parameter mixing method. A special instantiation yields a parallel stochastic gradient descent method with strong convergence.

Penalized maximum likelihood estimation of this matrix yields a simple regression interpretation for local dependence in which variables are predicted by their neighbors.

The results establish that momentum methods are equivalent to the standard stochastic gradient method with a re-scaled (larger) step-size value. The size of the re-scaling is determined by the value of the momentum parameter. The equivalence result is established for all time instants and not only in steady-state. The analysis is carried out for general strongly convex and smooth risk functions, and is not limited to quadratic risks. One notable conclusion is that the well-known benefits of momentum constructions for deterministic optimization problems do not necessarily carry over to the adaptive online setting when small constant step-sizes are used to enable continuous adaptation and learning in the presence of persistent gradient noise. From simulations, the equivalence between momentum and standard stochastic gradient methods is also observed for non-differentiable and non-convex problems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2016,17,,,,,,,,192,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000391826600001,0

Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) is a generalization of standard reinforcement learning where the scalar reward signal is extended to multiple feedback signals, in essence, one for each objective. MORL is the process of learning policies that optimize multiple criteria simultaneously. In this paper, we present a novel temporal difference learning algorithm that integrates the Pareto dominance relation into a reinforcement learning approach. This algorithm is a multi-policy algorithm that learns a set of Pareto dominating policies in a single run. We name this algorithm Pareto Q-learning and it is applicable in episodic environments with deterministic as well as stochastic transition functions. A crucial aspect of Pareto Q-learning is the updating mechanism that bootstraps sets of Q-vectors. One of our main contributions in this paper is a mechanism that separates the expected immediate reward vector from the set of expected future discounted reward vectors. This decomposition allows us to update the sets and to exploit the learned policies consistently throughout the state space. To balance exploration and exploitation during learning, we also propose three set evaluation mechanisms. These three mechanisms evaluate the sets of vectors to accommodate for standard action selection strategies, such as epsilon-greedy. More precisely, these mechanisms use multi-objective evaluation principles such as the hypervolume measure, the cardinality indicator and the Pareto dominance relation to select the most promising actions. We experimentally validate the algorithm on multiple environments with two and three objectives and we demonstrate that Pareto Q-learning outperforms current state-of-the-art MORL algorithms with respect to the hypervolume of the obtained policies. We note that (1) Pareto Q-learning is able to learn the entire Pareto front under the usual assumption that each state-action pair is sufficiently sampled, while (2) not being biased by the shape of the Pareto front. Furthermore, (3) the set evaluation mechanisms provide indicative measures for local action selection and (4) the learned policies can be retrieved throughout the state and action space.",,,,,,"Nowe, Ann/0000-0001-6346-4564",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,NOV,2014,15,,,,,,3483,3512,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000353126200005,0

In this paper, we make two main technical contributions.

To address the SIP, we propose an efficient feature generating paradigm. Different from traditional gradient-based approaches that conduct optimization on all input features, the proposed paradigm iteratively activates a group of features, and solves a sequence of multiple kernel learning (MKL) subproblems. To further speed up the training, we propose to solve the MKL subproblems in their primal forms through a modified accelerated proximal gradient approach. Due to such optimization scheme, some efficient cache techniques are also developed. The feature generating paradigm is guaranteed to converge globally under mild conditions, and can achieve lower feature selection bias. Moreover, the proposed method can tackle two challenging tasks in feature selection: 1) group-based feature selection with complex structures, and 2) nonlinear feature selection with explicit feature mappings.

We introduce a concept termed the facilitating score to account for both the confounding and interacting impacts of covariates on the treatment effect. Several approaches for estimating the facilitating score are discussed. In particular, we put forward a machine learning method, called causal inference tree (CIT), to provide a piecewise constant approximation of the facilitating score. With interpretable rules, CIT splits data in such a way that both the propensity and the treatment effect become more homogeneous within each resultant partition. Causal inference at different levels can be made on the basis of CIT. Together with an aggregated grouping procedure, CIT stratifies data into strata where causal effects can be conveniently assessed within each. Besides, a feasible way of predicting individual causal effects (ICE) is made available by aggregating ensemble CIT models. Both the stratified results and the estimated ICE provide an assessment of heterogeneity of causal effects and can be integrated for estimating the average causal effect (ACE). Mean square consistency of CIT is also established.

The difference in these costs is known as the regret of the algorithm. The term bandit refers to the setting where one only obtains the cost of the decision used in a given iteration and no other information. A very general form of this problem is the non-stochastic bandit linear optimization problem, where the set of decisions is a convex set in some Euclidean space, and the cost functions are linear.

In the present paper, we theoretically compare the Bayes cross-validation loss and the widely applicable information criterion and prove two theorems. First, the Bayes cross-validation loss is asymptotically equivalent to the widely applicable information criterion as a random variable. Therefore, model selection and hyperparameter optimization using these two values are asymptotically equivalent. Second, the sum of the Bayes generalization error and the Bayes cross-validation error is asymptotically equal to 2 lambda/n, where lambda is the real log canonical threshold and n is the number of training samples.

The conditions for success of these methods are now well-understood: (1) exact recovery in the noiseless setting is possible if and only if the design matrix X satisfies the restricted nullspace property, and (2) the squared l(2)-error of a Lasso estimate decays at the minimax optimal rate klogp/n, where k is the sparsity of the p-dimensional regression problem with additive Gaussian noise, whenever the design satisfies a restricted eigenvalue condition. The key issue is thus to determine when the design matrix X satisfies these desirable properties. Thus far, there have been numerous results showing that the restricted isometry property, which implies both the restricted nullspace and eigenvalue conditions, is satisfied when all entries of X are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), or the rows are unitary. This paper proves directly that the restricted nullspace and eigenvalue conditions hold with high probability for quite general classes of Gaussian matrices for which the predictors may be highly dependent, and hence restricted isometry conditions can be violated with high probability. In this way, our results extend the attractive theoretical guarantees on l(1)-relaxations to a much broader class of problems than the case of completely independent or unitary designs.",,,,,,"Wainwright, Martin J./0000-0002-8760-2236",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,AUG,2010,11,,,,,,2241,2259,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000282523300008,0

Moreover, hidden or latent variables are often an important component of graphical models. However, DAG models suffer from an important limitation: the family of DAGs is not closed under marginalization of hidden variables. This means that in general we cannot use a DAG to represent the independencies over a subset of variables in a larger DAG. Directed mixed graphs (DMGs) are a representation that includes DAGs as a special case, and overcomes this limitation. This paper introduces algorithms for performing Bayesian inference in Gaussian and probit DMG models. An important requirement for inference is the specification of the distribution over parameters of the models. We introduce a new distribution for covariance matrices of Gaussian DMGs.

Since the 1970's, the standard computational primitive has been to find the most consistent hypothesis in a given complexity class. In contrast, in this paper we propose a new basic operation: for each pair of input instances, count how many concepts of bounded complexity contain both of them. Our approach maps instances to a Hilbert space, whose metric is induced by a universal kernel coinciding with our computational primitive, and identifies concepts with half-spaces. We prove that all concepts are linearly separable under this mapping. Hence, given a labeled sample and an oracle for evaluating the universal kernel, we can efficiently compute a linear classifier (via SVM, for example) and use margin bounds to control its generalization error. Even though exact evaluation of the universal kernel may be infeasible, in various natural situations it is efficiently approximable. Though our approach is general, our main application is to regular languages. Our approach presents a substantial departure from current learning paradigms and in particular yields a novel method for learning this fundamental concept class. Unlike existing techniques, we make no structural assumptions on the corresponding unknown automata, the string distribution or the completeness of the training set. Instead, given a labeled sample our algorithm outputs a classifier with guaranteed distribution-free generalization bounds; to our knowledge, the proposed framework is the only one capable of achieving the latter.

Unlike the case where a feature exists but its value is not observed, here we focus on the case where a feature may not even exist (structurally absent) for some of the samples. The common approach for handling missing features in discriminative models is to first complete their unknown values, and then use a standard classification procedure over the completed data. This paper focuses on features that are known to be non-existing, rather than have an unknown value. We show how incomplete data can be classified directly without any completion of the missing features using a max-margin learning framework. We formulate an objective function, based on the geometric interpretation of the margin, that aims to maximize the margin of each sample in its own relevant subspace. In this formulation, the linearly separable case can be transformed into a binary search over a series of second order cone programs (SOCP), a convex problem that can be solved efficiently. We also describe two approaches for optimizing the general case: an approximation that can be solved as a standard quadratic program (QP) and an iterative approach for solving the exact problem. By avoiding the pre-processing phase in which the data is completed, both of these approaches could offer considerable computational savings. More importantly, we show that the elegant handling of missing values by our approach allows it to both outperform other methods when the missing values have non-trivial structure, and be competitive with other methods when the values are missing at random.

Co-clustering has enjoyed wide success in varied application domains such as text clustering, gene-microarray analysis, natural language processing and image, speech and video analysis. In this paper, we introduce a partitional co-clustering formulation that is driven by the search for a good matrix approximation-every co-clustering is associated with an approximation of the original data matrix and the quality of co-clustering is determined by the approximation error. We allow the approximation error to be measured using a large class of loss functions called Bregman divergences that include squared Euclidean distance and KL-divergence as special cases. In addition, we permit multiple structurally different co-clustering schemes that preserve various linear statistics of the original data matrix. To accomplish the above tasks, we introduce a new minimum Bregman information (MBI) principle that simultaneously generalizes the maximum entropy and standard least squares principles, and leads to a matrix approximation that is optimal among all generalized additive models in a certain natural parameter space. Analysis based on this principle yields an elegant meta algorithm, special cases of which include most previously known alternate minimization based clustering algorithms such as kmeans and co-clustering algorithms such as information theoretic (Dhillon et al., 2003b) and minimum sum-squared residue co-clustering (Cho et al., 2004).

We then use this analysis to better understand the role of graph Laplacian matrix normalization. Under assumptions that the cut is small, we derive near-optimal normalization factors by approximately minimizing the generalization bounds. The analysis reveals the limitations of the standard degree-based normalization method in that the resulting normalization factors can vary significantly within each connected component with the same class label, which may cause inferior generalization performance.

Within this popular model class, and when the effective rank of sigma is smaller than n, while still allowing for p >> n, both the bias and the variance terms of the excess risk can be controlled, and the risk of the minimum-norm interpolating predictor approaches optimal benchmarks.

To address these issues, the current paper proposes a new communication-efficient distributed learning algorithm for sparse partially linear models with an increasing number of features. The proposed method is based on the classical divide and conquer strategy for handling big data and the computation on each subsample consists of a debiased estimation of the doubly regularized least squares approach. With the proposed method, we theoretically prove that our global parametric estimator can achieve the optimal parametric rate in our semi-parametric model given an appropriate partition on the total data. Specifically, the choice of data partition relies on the underlying smoothness of the nonparametric component, and it is adaptive to the sparsity parameter.

Exact inference in these models is generally intractable and so practitioners typically apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for posterior inference. The most widely used MCMC strategies rely on a single variable Gibbs update of the feature allocation matrix. These updates can be inefficient as features are typically strongly correlated. To overcome this problem we have developed a block sampler that can update an entire row of the feature allocation matrix in a single move. In the context of feature allocation models, naive block Gibbs sampling is impractical for models with a large number of features as the computational complexity scales exponentially in the number of features. We develop a Particle Gibbs (PG) sampler that targets the same distribution as the row wise Gibbs updates, but has computational complexity that only grows linearly in the number of features. We compare the performance of our proposed methods to the standard Gibbs sampler using synthetic and real data from a range of feature allocation models.

These methods take as input a graph and a seed node, and they return as output a good cluster in a running time that depends on the size of the output cluster but that is independent of the size of the input graph. In this paper, we adopt a statistical perspective on local graph clustering, and we analyze the per-formance of the l(1)-regularized PageRank method (Fountoulakis et al., 2019) for the recovery of a single target cluster, given a seed node inside the cluster. Assuming the target cluster has been generated by a random model, we present two results. In the first, we show that the optimal sup-port of l(1)-regularized PageRank recovers the full target cluster, with bounded false positives. In the second, we show that if the seed node is connected solely to the target cluster then the optimal sup-port of l(1)-regularized PageRank recovers exactly the target cluster. We also show empirically that l(1)-regularized PageRank has a state-of-the-art performance on many real graphs, demonstrating the superiority of the method. From a computational perspective, we show that the solution path of l(1)-regularized PageRank is monotonic. This allows for the application of the forward stagewise algorithm, which approximates the entire solution path in running time that does not depend on the size of the whole graph. Finally, we show that l(1)-regularized PageRank and approximate per-sonalized PageRank (APPR) (Andersen et al., 2006), another very popular method for local graph clustering, are equivalent in the sense that we can lower and upper bound the output of one with the output of the other.

Here, we first revisit this concentration phenomenon and prove it under slightly weaker assumptions, for a set of random vectors symmetrically distributed around the origin. Second, we empirically evaluate the relation between PMI and scalar products of word vectors satisfying the concentration property. Our empirical results indicate that, in practice, this relation does not hold with arbitrarily small error. This observation is further supported by two theoretical results: (i) the error cannot be exactly zero because the corresponding shifted PMI matrix cannot be positive semidefinite; (ii) under mild assumptions, there exist pairs of words for which the error cannot be close to zero.

A popular approach in practice is to factorize the matrix into two compact low-rank factors, and then optimize these factors directly via simple iterative methods such as gradient descent and alternating minimization. Despite nonconvexity, recent literatures have shown that these simple heuristics in fact achieve linear convergence when initialized properly for a growing number of problems of interest. However, upon closer examination, existing approaches can still be computationally expensive especially for ill-conditioned matrices: the convergence rate of gradient descent depends linearly on the condition number of the low-rank matrix, while the per-iteration cost of alternating minimization is often prohibitive for large matrices. The goal of this paper is to set forth a competitive algorithmic approach dubbed Scaled Gradient Descent (ScaledGD) which can be viewed as preconditioned or diagonally-scaled gradient descent, where the preconditioners are adaptive and iteration-varying with a minimal computational overhead. With tailored variants for low-rank matrix sensing, robust principal component analysis and matrix completion, we theoretically show that ScaledGD achieves the best of both worlds: it converges linearly at a rate independent of the condition number of the low-rank matrix similar as alternating minimization, while maintaining the low per-iteration cost of gradient descent. Our analysis is also applicable to general loss functions that are restricted strongly convex and smooth over low-rank matrices. To the best of our knowledge, ScaledGD is the first algorithm that provably has such properties over a wide range of low-rank matrix estimation tasks. At the core of our analysis is the introduction of a new distance function that takes account of the preconditioners when measuring the distance between the iterates and the ground truth. Finally, numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of ScaledGD in accelerating the convergence rate of ill-conditioned low-rank matrix estimation in a wide number of applications.

At each time period, the seller offers an arriving customer an assortment of substitutable products under a cardinality constraint, and the customer makes the purchase among offered products according to a discrete choice model. Most existing work associates each product with a real-valued fixed mean utility and assumes a multinomial logit choice (MNL) model. In many practical applications, feature/contextual information of products is readily available. In this paper, we incorporate the feature information by assuming a linear relationship between the mean utility and the feature. In addition, we allow the feature information of products to change over time so that the underlying choice model can also be non-stationary. To solve the dynamic assortment optimization under this changing contextual MNL model, we need to simultaneously learn the underlying unknown coefficient and make the decision on the assortment. To this end, we develop an upper confidence bound (UCB) based policy and establish the regret bound on the order of (O) over tilde (d root T), where d is the dimension of the feature and (O) over tilde suppresses logarithmic dependence. We further establish a lower bound Omega(d root T/K), where K is the cardinality constraint of an offered assortment, which is usually small. When K is a constant, our policy is optimal up to logarithmic factors.

Unfortunately, risk scores (for example from Cox Proportional Hazard models) do not provide survival probabilities, single-time probability models (for instance the Gail model, predicting 5 year probability) only provide for a single time point, and standard Kaplan-Meier survival curves provide only population averages for a large class of patients, meaning they are not specific to individual patients. This motivates an alternative class of tools that can learn a model that provides an individual survival distribution for each subject, which gives survival probabilities across all times, such as extensions to the Cox model, Accelerated Failure Time, an extension to Random Survival Forests, and Multi-Task Logistic Regression. This paper first motivates such individual survival distribution (ISD) models, and explains how they differ from standard models. It then discusses ways to evaluate such models namely Concordance, 1-Calibration, Inte- grated Brier score, and versions of L1-loss then motivates and defines a novel approach, D-Calibration, which determines whether a model's probability estimates are meaningful. We also discuss how these measures differ, and use them to evaluate several ISD prediction tools over a range of survival data sets.

The performance of LDA depends heavily on the quality of estimating the mean vectors and the population covariance matrix. This issue becomes more challenging in high-dimensional settings where the number of features is of the same order as the number of training samples. Several techniques for estimating the covariance matrix can be found in the literature. One of the most popular approaches are estimators based on using a regularized sample covariance matrix, giving the name regularized LDA (R-LDA) to the corresponding classifier. These estimators are known to be more resilient to the sample noise than the traditional sample covariance matrix estimator. However, the main challenge of the regularization approach is the choice of the optimal regularization parameter, as an arbitrary choice could lead to severe degradation of the classifier performance. In this work, we propose an improved LDA classifier based on the assumption that the covariance matrix follows a spiked covariance model. The main principle of our proposed technique is the design of a parametrized inverse covariance matrix estimator, the parameters of which are shown to be easily optimized. Numerical simulations, using both real and synthetic data, show that the proposed classifier yields better classification performance than the classical R-LDA while requiring lower computational complexity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2020,21,,,,,,,,112,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000546629900001,0

In this paper, we quantify this phenomena and ask why neither the convolutional architecture nor data augmentation are sufficient to achieve the desired invariance. Specifically, we show that the convolutional architecture does not give invariance since architectures ignore the classical sampling theorem, and data augmentation does not give invariance because the CNNs learn to be invariant to transformations only for images that are very similar to typical images from the training set. We discuss two possible solutions to this problem: (1) antialiasing the intermediate representations and (2) increasing data augmentation and show that they provide only a partial solution at best.

One simply casts the problem as a gambler who repeatedly pulls one out of N slot machine arms, eliciting random rewards. Learning of reward probabilities is then combined with reward maximization, by carefully balancing reward exploration against reward exploitation. In this paper, we address a particularly intriguing variant of the multi-armed bandit problem, referred to as the Stochastic Point Location (SPL) problem. The gambler is here only told whether the optimal arm (point) lies to the left or to the right of the arm pulled, with the feedback being erroneous with probability 1 - pi. This formulation thus targets optimization in continuous action spaces with both informative and deceptive feedback. To tackle this class of problems, we formulate a compact and scalable Bayesian representation of the solution space that simultaneously captures both the location of the optimal arm as well as the probability of receiving correct feedback. We further introduce the accompanying Thompson Sampling guided Stochastic Point Location (TS-SPL) scheme for balancing exploration against exploitation. By learning pi, TS-SPL also supports deceptive environments that are lying about the direction of the optimal arm. This, in turn, allows us to address the fundamental Stochastic Root Finding (SRF) problem.

This result leads to several interesting theoretical and computational conclusions. Letting m and n denote the number of edges and nodes, respectively, of the graph in consideration, it implies that for an underlying signal with total variation t over the graph, the fused lasso (properly tuned) achieves a mean squared error rate of t(2/3) n(-2/3). Moreover, precisely the same mean squared error rate is achieved by running the ld fused lasso on the DFS-induced chain graph. Importantly, the latter estimator is simple and computationally cheap, requiring O(m) operations to construct the DFS-induced chain and 0(n) operations to compute the ld fused lasso solution over this chain. Further, for trees that have bounded maximum degree, the error rate of t(2/3) n(-2/3) cannot be improved, in the sense that it is the minimax rate for signals that have total variation t over the tree. Finally, several related results also hold for example, the analogous result holds for a roughness measure defined by the to norm of differences across edges in place of the total variation metric.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2018,18,,,,,,,,176,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000435443100001,0

The kernel maintains (strict) positive-definiteness. The corresponding kernel matrix admits a recursively off-diagonal low-rank structure, which allows for fast linear algebra computations. Suppressing the factor of data dimension, the memory and arithmetic complexities for training a regression or a classifier are reduced from O(n(2)) and O(n(3)) to O(nr) and O (nr(2)), respectively, where n is the number of training examples and r is the rank on each level of the hierarchy.

Invariance as a major design principle keeps the number of arbitrary choices to a minimum. The resulting IGO flow is the flow of an ordinary differential equation conducting the natural gradient ascent of an adaptive, time-dependent transformation of the objective function. It makes no particular assumptions on the objective function to be optimized. The IGO method produces explicit IGO algorithms through time discretization. It naturally recovers versions of known algorithms and offers a systematic way to derive new ones. In continuous search spaces, IGO algorithms take a form related to natural evolution strategies (NES). The cross-entropy method is recovered in a particular case with a large time step, and can be extended into a smoothed, parametrization-independent maximum likelihood update (IGO-ML). When applied to the family of Gaussian distributions on R-d, the IGO framework recovers a version of the well-known CMA-ES algorithm and of xNES. For the family of Bernoulli distributions on {0, 1}(d), we recover the seminal PBIL algorithm and cGA. For the distributions of restricted Boltzmann machines, we naturally obtain a novel algorithm for discrete optimization on {0, 1}(d). All these algorithms are natural instances of, and unified under, the single information-geometric optimization framework. The IGO method achieves, thanks to its intrinsic formulation, maximal invariance properties: invariance under reparametrization of the search space.., under a change of parameters of the probability distribution, and under increasing transformation of the function to be optimized. The latter is achieved through an adaptive, quantile-based formulation of the objective. Theoretical considerations strongly suggest that IGO algorithms are essentially characterized by a minimal change of the distribution over time. Therefore they have minimal loss in diversity through the course of optimization, provided the initial diversity is high. First experiments using restricted Boltzmann machines confirm this insight. As a simple consequence, IGO seems to provide, from information theory, an elegant way to simultaneously explore several valleys of a fitness landscape in a single run.",,,,,"Hansen, Nikolaus/U-6988-2019","Hansen, Nikolaus/0000-0001-7788-4906",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2017,18,,,,,,,,18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000399839000001,0

Many important machine learning and statistical tasks fit into this framework, including multi-instance learning and point estimation problems without analytical solution (such as hyperparameter or entropy estimation). Despite the large number of available heuristics in the literature, the inherent two-stage sampled nature of the problem makes the theoretical analysis quite challenging, since in practice only samples from sampled distributions are observable, and the estimates have to rely on similarities computed between sets of points. To the best of our knowledge, the only existing technique with consistency guarantees for distribution regression requires kernel density estimation as an intermediate step (which often performs poorly in practice), and the domain of the distributions to be compact Euclidean. In this paper, we study a simple, analytically computable, ridge regression-based alternative to distribution regression, where we embed the distributions to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and learn the regressor from the embeddings to the outputs. Our main contribution is to prove that this scheme is consistent in the two-stage sampled setup under mild conditions (on separable topological domains enriched with kernels): we present an exact computational-statistical efficiency trade-off analysis showing that our estimator is able to match the one-stage sampled minimax optimal rate (Caponnetto and De Vito, 2007; Steinwart et al., 2009).

We show that the auto-encoder captures the score (derivative of the log-density with respect to the input). It contradicts previous interpretations of reconstruction error as an energy function. Unlike previous results, the theorems provided here are completely generic and do not depend on the parameterization of the auto-encoder: they show what the auto-encoder would tend to if given enough capacity and examples. These results are for a contractive training criterion we show to be similar to the denoising auto-encoder training criterion with small corruption noise, but with contraction applied on the whole reconstruction function rather than just encoder. Similarly to score matching, one can consider the proposed training criterion as a convenient alternative to maximum likelihood because it does not involve a partition function.

This makes explicit the previously unstated assumptions of a large class of co-training type algorithms, and also clarifies the circumstances under which these assumptions fail. Building upon new insights from this model, we propose an improved method for co-training, which is a novel co-training kernel for Gaussian process classifiers.

The Bayesian co-training approach can also elegantly handle data samples with missing views, that is, some of the views are not available for some data points at learning time. This is further extended to an active sensing framework, in which the missing (sample, view) pairs are actively acquired to improve learning performance. The strength of active sensing model is that one actively sensed (sample, view) pair would improve the joint multi-view classification on all the samples.

The majority of existing work on grammar induction has favoured model simplicity (and thus learnability) over representational capacity by using context free grammars and first order dependency grammars, which are not sufficiently expressive to model many common linguistic constructions. We propose a novel compromise by inferring a probabilistic tree substitution grammar, a formalism which allows for arbitrarily large tree fragments and thereby better represent complex linguistic structures. To limit the model's complexity we employ a Bayesian non-parametric prior which biases the model towards a sparse grammar with shallow productions. We demonstrate the model's efficacy on supervised phrase-structure parsing, where we induce a latent segmentation of the training treebank, and on unsupervised dependency grammar induction.

Hinton et al. recently proposed a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning procedure relying on the training algorithm of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) to initialize the parameters of a deep belief network (DBN), a generative model with many layers of hidden causal variables. This was followed by the proposal of another greedy layer-wise procedure, relying on the usage of autoassociator networks. In the context of the above optimization problem, we study these algorithms empirically to better understand their success. Our experiments confirm the hypothesis that the greedy layer-wise unsupervised training strategy helps the optimization by initializing weights in a region near a good local minimum, but also implicitly acts as a sort of regularization that brings better generalization and encourages internal distributed representations that are high-level abstractions of the input. We also present a series of experiments aimed at evaluating the link between the performance of deep neural networks and practical aspects of their topology, for example, demonstrating cases where the addition of more depth helps.

Models are being sought at different scales of biological organisation namely: sub-cellular, cellular, tissue, organ, organism and ecosystem; with a view of identifying how different components are connected together, how they are controlled and how they behave when functioning as a system. Except for very simple biological processes, system identification from first principles can be extremely difficult. This has brought into focus automated techniques for constructing models using data of system behaviour. Such techniques face three principal issues: (1) The model representation language must be rich enough to capture system behaviour; (2) The system identification technique must be powerful enough to identify substantially complex models; and (3) There may not be sufficient data to obtain both the model's structure and precise estimates of all of its parameters. In this paper, we address these issues in the following ways: (1) Models are represented in an expressive subset of first-order logic. Specifically, they are expressed as logic programs; (2) System identification is done using techniques developed in Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). This allows the identification of first-order logic models from data. Specifically, we employ an incremental approach in which increasingly complex models are constructed from simpler ones using snapshots of system behaviour; and (3) We restrict ourselves to qualitative models. These are non-parametric: thus, usually less data are required than for identifying parametric quantitative models. A further advantage is that the data need not be precise numerical observations (instead, they are abstractions like positive, negative, zero, increasing, decreasing and so on). We describe incremental construction of qualitative models using a simple physical system and demonstrate its application to identification of models at four scales of biological organisation, namely: (a) a predator-prey model at the ecosystem level; (b) a model for the human lung at the organ level; (c) a model for regulation of glucose by insulin in the human body at the extra-cellular level; and (d) a model for the glycolysis metabolic pathway at the cellular level.",,,,,,"King, Ross/0000-0001-7208-4387",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,JUL,2008,9,,,,,,1475,1533,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000258646800007,0

While exact maximum-likelihood learning of the parameters of this model proves to be intractable, we show that efficient approximations to expectation-maximization (EM) can be found in the case of sparsely active hidden causes. One of these approximations can be formulated as a neural network model with a generalized softmax activation function and Hebbian learning. Thus, we show that learning in recent softmax-like neural networks may be interpreted as approximate maximization of a data likelihood.

We show how these partitions can be used to build univariate predictors and multivariate ones under a naive Bayes assumption. We also propose a new evaluation criterion for probabilistic rank estimators. Based on the logarithmic score, we show that such criterion presents the advantage to be minored, which is not the case of the logarithmic score computed for probabilistic value estimator.

A second set of experimentations on real data shows competitive performance of the univariate and selective naive Bayes rank estimators projected on the value range compared to methods submitted to a recent challenge on probabilistic metric regression tasks. Our approach is applicable for all regression problems with categorical or numerical predictors. It is particularly interesting for those with a high number of predictors as it automatically detects the variables which contain predictive information. It builds pertinent predictors of the normalized rank of the numerical target from one or several predictors.

However, the underlying protein classification problem is in fact a huge multiclass problem, with over 1000 protein folds and even more structural subcategories organized into a hierarchy. To handle this challenging many-class problem while taking advantage of progress on the binary problem, we introduce an adaptive code approach in the output space of one-vs-the-rest prediction scores. Specifically, we use a ranking perceptron algorithm to learn a weighting of binary classifiers that improves multi-class prediction with respect to a fixed set of output codes. We use a cross-validation set-up to generate output vectors for training, and we define codes that capture information about the protein structural hierarchy. Our code weighting approach significantly improves on the standard one-vs-all method for two difficult multi-class protein classification problems: remote homology detection and fold recognition.

This paper first compares several different methods-predictive value imputation, the distribution-based imputation used by C4.5, and using reduced models-for applying classification trees to instances with missing values ( and also shows evidence that the results generalize to bagged trees and to logistic regression). The results show that for the two most popular treatments, each is preferable under different conditions. Strikingly the reduced-models approach, seldom mentioned or used, consistently outperforms the other two methods, sometimes by a large margin. The lack of attention to reduced modeling may be due in part to its ( perceived) expense in terms of computation or storage. Therefore, we then introduce and evaluate alternative, hybrid approaches that allow users to balance between more accurate but computationally expensive reduced modeling and the other, less accurate but less computationally expensive treatments. The results show that the hybrid methods can scale gracefully to the amount of investment in computation/storage, and that they outperform imputation even for small investments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,JUL,2007,8,,,,,,1625,1657,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000249353700009,0

Model selection is a commonly used method to find such models, but usually involves a computationally heavy combinatorial search. Lasso (Tibshirani, 1996) is now being used as a computationally feasible alternative to model selection. Therefore it is important to study Lasso for model selection purposes. In this paper, we prove that a single condition, which we call the Irrepresentable Condition, is almost necessary and sufficient for Lasso to select the true model both in the classical fixed p setting and in the large p setting as the sample size n gets large. Based on these results, sufficient conditions that are verifiable in practice are given to relate to previous works and help applications of Lasso for feature selection and sparse representation. This Irrepresentable Condition, which depends mainly on the covariance of the predictor variables, states that Lasso selects the true model consistently if and (almost) only if the predictors that are not in the true model are irrepresentable (in a sense to be clarified) by predictors that are in the true model.

We introduce a new algorithm that incrementally learns a linear-threshold classifier for each node of the taxonomy. A hierarchical classification is obtained by evaluating the trained node classifiers in a top-down fashion. To evaluate classifiers in our multipath framework, we define a new hierarchical loss function, the H-loss, capturing the intuition that whenever a classification mistake is made on a node of the taxonomy, then no loss should be charged for any additional mistake occurring in the subtree of that node. Making no assumptions on the mechanism generating the data instances, and assuming a linear noise model for the labels, we bound the H-loss of our on-line algorithm in terms of the H-loss of a reference classifier knowing the true parameters of the label-generating process. We show that, in expectation, the excess cumulative H-loss grows at most logarithmically in the length of the data sequence. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the precise dependence of the rate of convergence on the eigenstructure of the data each node observes.

Consider a collection {h(a)} of classifiers indexed by a finite-dimensional parameter a, and the classifier h(a*) that minimizes the prediction error over this class. The parameter a* is estimated by the empirical risk minimizer (a) over cap (n) over the class, where the empirical risk is calculated on a training sample of size n. We apply the Kim Pollard Theorem to show that under certain differentiability assumptions, (a) over cap (n) converges to a* with rate n(-1/3), and also present the asymptotic distribution of the renormalized estimator. For example, let V-0 denote the set of x on which, given X = x, the label Y = 1 is more likely (than the label Y = -1). If X is one-dimensional, the set V-0 is the union of disjoint intervals. The problem is then to estimate the thresholds of the intervals. We obtain the asymptotic distribution of the empirical risk minimizer when the classifiers have K thresholds, where K is fixed.

The current work extends these ideas to obtain continuous representations that preserve relevant information, rather than discrete clusters, for the special case of multivariate Gaussian variables. While the general continuous IB problem is difficult to solve, we provide an analytic solution for the optimal representation and tradeoff between compression and relevance for the this important case. The obtained optimal representation is a noisy linear projection to eigenvectors of the normalized regression matrix Sigma(x vertical bar y)Sigma(-1)(x), which is also the basis obtained in canonical correlation analysis. However, in Gaussian IB, the compression tradeoff parameter uniquely determines the dimension, as well as the scale of each eigenvector, through a cascade of structural phase transitions. This introduces a novel interpretation where solutions of different ranks lie on a continuum parametrized by the compression level. Our analysis also provides a complete analytic expression of the preserved information as a function of the compression (the information-curve), in terms of the eigenvalue spectrum of the data. As in the discrete case, the information curve is concave and smooth, though it is made of different analytic segments for each optimal dimension.

Motivated by subspace algorithms in systems theory, where the doubly infinite system Hankel matrix captures both order and good lower order approximations, we construct a Hankel-like matrix from noisy finite data using ordinary least squares. This circumvents the non-convexities that arise in system identification, and allows accurate estimation of the underlying LTI system.

However, the independence assumption may be unrealistic for many scenarios such as modeling multiple time series, spatial processes, and functional data, where the outcomes are correlated. In this paper, we introduce the generalized probabilistic principal component analysis (GPPCA) to study the latent factor model for multiple correlated outcomes, where each factor is modeled by a Gaussian process. Our method generalizes the previous probabilistic formulation of PCA (PPCA) by providing the closed-form maximum marginal likelihood estimator of the factor loadings and other parameters.

Worse still, the asset price relatives are not likely subject to any proper distributions. These facts violate the statistical assumptions of the traditional covariance estimates and invalidate their statistical efficiency and consistency in risk measurement. In this paper, we propose to reconsider the function of covariance estimates in the perspective of operators, and establish a rank-one covariance estimate in the principal rank-one tangent space at the observation matrix.

To resolve this dilemma while still retaining the generalizability of the underlying local inference method, we apply the idea of expectation propagation (EP) as a framework for distributed Bayesian inference. The central idea is to iteratively update approximations to the local likelihoods given the state of the other approximations and the prior. The present paper has two roles: we review the steps that are needed to keep EP algorithms numerically stable, and we suggest a general approach, inspired by EP, for approaching data partitioning problems in a way that achieves the computational benefits of parallelism while allowing each local update to make use of relevant information from the other sites.

In this paper, we make two attempts to resolve this issue by investigating conditions on the loss functions that allow us to remove such a limit. In our first attempt, we show that if the loss function is (infinity, T)-smooth, by using the Bernstein polynomial approximation we can avoid the exponential dependency in the term of alpha. We then propose player-efficient algorithms with 1-bit communication complexity and O(1) computation cost for each player. The error bound of these algorithms is asymptotically the same as the original one. With some additional assumptions, we also give an algorithm which is more efficient for the server. In our second attempt, we show that for any 1-Lipschitz generalized linear convex loss function, there is an (epsilon, delta)-LDP algorithm whose sample complexity for achieving error alpha is only linear in the dimensionality p.

These deep structures are probability distributions, designed through hierarchical construction, which are conditionally Gaussian. In this paper, the current published body of work is placed in a common framework and, through recursion, several classes of deep Gaussian processes are defined. The resulting samples generated from a deep Gaussian process have a Markovian structure with respect to the depth parameter, and the effective depth of the resulting process is interpreted in terms of the ergodicity, or non-ergodicity, of the resulting Markov chain. For the classes of deep Gaussian processes introduced, we provide results concerning their ergodicity and hence their effective depth. We also demonstrate how these processes may be used for inference; in particular we show how a Metropolis-within-Gibbs construction across the levels of the hierarchy can be used to derive sampling tools which are robust to the level of resolution used to represent the functions on a computer.

If actions are associated with feature vectors that underlie their usefulness, the discovery of a mapping parameter between such profiles and rewards can help the exploration process of the bandit strategies. This is the setting studied in this paper, but in our case the action profiles (constant feature vectors) are unknown beforehand. Instead, the agent is only given sample vectors, with mean centered on the true profiles, for a subset of actions at each step of the process.

It generalizes the notion of minimal sufficient statistics from classical parametric statistics to a broader information-theoretic sense.

Specifically, it is achieved by minimizing the level of mutual information (MI) between the representation and the original variables, subject to a minimal level of MI between the representation and the target. This problem is shown to be in general NP hard. One important exception is the multivariate Gaussian case, for which the Gaussian IB (GIB) is known to obtain an analytical closed form solution, similar to Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). In this work we introduce a Gaussian lower bound to the IB curve; we find an embedding of the data which maximizes its Gaussian part, on which we apply the GIB. This embedding provides an efficient (and practical) representation of any arbitrary data-set (in the IB sense), which in addition holds the favorable properties of a Gaussian distribution.

Then, we show that finite completability of the sampled tensor is equivalent to having a certain number of algebraically independent polynomials among the defined polynomials. Our proposed approach results in characterizing the maximum number of algebraically independent polynomials in terms of a simple geometric structure of the sampling pattern, and therefore we obtain the deterministic necessary and sufficient condition on the sampling pattern for finite completability of the sampled tensor. Moreover, assuming that the entries of the tensor are sampled independently with probability p and using the mentioned deterministic analysis, we propose a combinatorial method to derive a lower bound on the sampling probability p, or equivalently, the number of sampled entries that guarantees finite completability with high probability.

The closely related problem of testing serial independence of a multivariate stationary sequence is also considered. The Mobius transformation of characteristic functions is used to characterize independence. A generalization to p vectors of distance covariance and Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) tests with the translation invariant kernel of a stable probability distribution is proposed. Both test statistics can be expressed in a simple form as a sum over all elements of a componentwise product of p doubly-centered matrices. It is shown that an HSIC statistic with sufficiently small scale parameters is equivalent to a distance covariance statistic. Consistency and weak convergence of both types of statistics are established. Approximation of p - values is made by randomization tests without recomputing interpoint distances for each randomized sample. The dependogram is adapted to the proposed tests for the graphical identification of sources of dependencies. Empirical rejection rates obtained through extensive simulations confirm both the applicability of the testing procedures in small samples and the high level of competitiveness in terms of power.

The measure quantifies the heterogeneity of the correlations and is defined as the distance between a correlation matrix and the nearest correlation matrix with constant off-diagonal entries. This non-parametric notion generalizes existing test statistics for equality of correlation coefficients by allowing for alternative distance metrics, such as the Bures and other distances from quantum information theory. For several distance and dissimilarity metrics, we derive closed-form expressions of informativeness, which can be applied as objective functions for machine learning applications. Empirically, we demonstrate that informativeness is a useful criterion for selecting kernel parameters, choosing the dimension for kernel-based nonlinear dimensionality reduction, and identifying structured graphs. We also consider the problem of finding a maximally informative correlation matrix around a target matrix, and explore parameterizing the optimization in terms of the coordinates of the sample or through a lower-dimensional embedding. In the latter case, we find that maximizing the Bures-based informativeness measure, which is maximal for centered rank-1 correlation matrices, is equivalent to minimizing a specific matrix norm, and present an algorithm to solve the minimization problem using the norm's proximal operator.

This trade-off is formulated as a constrained optimization problem: maximize utility subject to local differential privacy constraints. We introduce a combinatorial family of extremal privatization mechanisms, which we call staircase mechanisms, and show that it contains the optimal privatization mechanisms for a broad class of information theoretic utilities such as mutual information and f-divergences. We further prove that for any utility function and any privacy level, solving the privacy-utility maximization problem is equivalent to solving a finite-dimensional linear program, the outcome of which is the optimal staircase mechanism. However, solving this linear program can be computationally expensive since it has a number of variables that is exponential in the size of the alphabet the data lives in. To account for this, we show that two simple privatization mechanisms, the binary and randomized response mechanisms, are universally optimal in the low and high privacy regimes, and well approximate the intermediate regime.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2016,17,,,,,,,,17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000391472600001,0

A major challenge arising from data integration pertains to data heterogeneity in terms of study population, study design, or study coordination. Ignoring such heterogeneity in data analysis may result in biased estimation and misleading inference. Traditional techniques of remedy to data heterogeneity include the use of interactions and random effects, which are inferior to achieving desirable statistical power or providing a meaningful interpretation, especially when a large number of smaller data sets are combined. In this paper, we propose a regularized fusion method that allows us to identify and merge inter-study homogeneous parameter clusters in regression analysis, without the use of hypothesis testing approach.

In this work, we present algorithm COmbINE, which accepts a collection of data sets over overlapping variable sets under different experimental conditions; COmbINE then outputs a summary of all causal models indicating the invariant and variant structural characteristics of all models that simultaneously fit all of the input data sets.

In this paper, we investigate two popular large-margin classification methods, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Distance Weighted Discrimination (DWD), under two contexts: the high-dimensional, low-sample size data and the imbalanced data. A unified family of classification machines, the FLexible Assortment MachinE (FLAME) is proposed, within which DWD and SVM are special cases. The FLAME family helps to identify the similarities and differences between SVM and DWD. It is well known that many classifiers overfit the data in the high-dimensional setting; and others are sensitive to the imbalanced data, that is, the class with a larger sample size overly influences the classifier and pushes the decision boundary towards the minority class. SVM is resistant to the imbalanced data issue, but it overfits high-dimensional data sets by showing the undesired data-piling phenomenon. The DWD method was proposed to improve SVM in the high dimensional setting, but its decision boundary is sensitive to the imbalanced ratio of sample sizes. Our FLAME family helps to understand an intrinsic connection between SVM and DWD, and provides a trade-off between sensitivity to the imbalanced data and overfitting the high-dimensional data. Several asymptotic properties of the FLAME classifiers are studied.

One popular approach for learning such skills is contextual policy search in which the individual tasks are represented as context vectors. We are interested in settings in which the agent is able to actively select the tasks that it examines during the learning process. We argue that there is a better way than selecting each task equally often because some tasks might be easier to learn at the beginning and the knowledge that the agent can extract from these tasks can be transferred to similar but more difficult tasks. The methods that we propose for addressing the task-selection problem model the learning process as a non-stationary multi-armed bandit problem with custom intrinsic reward heuristics so that the estimated learning progress will be maximized. This approach does neither make any assumptions about the underlying contextual policy search algorithm nor about the policy representation.

The applications of interest are: Learning to rank from pairwise preferences, and clustering with side information (a.k.a. semi-supervised clustering).

We prove that such an estimator implies the existence of a learning algorithm which, at each iteration, reduces its in-class excess risk to within a constant factor.

This problem arises naturally when data about a test sample is collected over time, or when costs must be incurred to compute the classification features. For example, in a distributed sensor network only a fraction of the sensors may have reported measurements at a certain time, and additional time, power, and bandwidth is needed to collect the complete data to classify. A practical goal is to assign a class label as soon as enough data is available to make a good decision. We formalize this goal through the notion of reliability-the probability that a label assigned given incomplete data would be the same as the label assigned given the complete data, and we propose a method to classify incomplete data only if some reliability threshold is met. Our approach models the complete data as a random variable whose distribution is dependent on the current incomplete data and the (complete) training data. The method differs from standard imputation strategies in that our focus is on determining the reliability of the classification decision, rather than just the class label. We show that the method provides useful reliability estimates of the correctness of the imputed class labels on a set of experiments on time-series data sets, where the goal is to classify the time-series as early as possible while still guaranteeing that the reliability threshold is met.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,DEC,2013,14,,,,,,3561,3589,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000335457100003,0

Well known examples of QS penalties include the l(2), Huber, l(1) and Vapnik losses. We build on a dual representation for QS functions, using it to characterize conditions necessary to interpret these functions as negative logs of true probability densities. This interpretation establishes the foundation for statistical modeling with both known and new QS loss functions, and enables construction of non-smooth multivariate distributions with specified means and variances from simple scalar building blocks. The main contribution of this paper is a flexible statistical modeling framework for a variety of learning applications, together with a toolbox of efficient numerical methods for estimation. In particular, a broad subclass of QS loss functions known as piecewise linear quadratic (PLQ) penalties has a dual representation that can be exploited to design interior point (IP) methods. IP methods solve nonsmooth optimization problems by working directly with smooth systems of equations characterizing their optimality. We provide several numerical examples, along with a code that can be used to solve general PLQ problems. The efficiency of the IP approach depends on the structure of particular applications. We consider the class of dynamic inverse problems using Kalman smoothing. This class comprises a wide variety of applications, where the aim is to reconstruct the state of a dynamical system with known process and measurement models starting from noisy output samples. In the classical case, Gaussian errors are assumed both in the process and measurement models for such problems. We show that the extended framework allows arbitrary PLQ densities to be used, and that the proposed IP approach solves the generalized Kalman smoothing problem while maintaining the linear complexity in the size of the time series, just as in the Gaussian case. This extends the computational efficiency of the Mayne-Fraser and Rauch-Tung-Striebel algorithms to a much broader nonsmooth setting, and includes many recently proposed robust and sparse smoothers as special cases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,SEP,2013,14,,,,,,2689,2728,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000327007400007,0

Our motivation stems from the observation that most algorithms proposed for online convex optimization require a projection onto the convex set K from which the decisions are made. While the projection is straightforward for simple shapes (e.g., Euclidean ball), for arbitrary complex sets it is the main computational challenge and may be inefficient in practice. In this paper, we consider an alternative online convex optimization problem. Instead of requiring that decisions belong to K for all rounds, we only require that the constraints, which define the set K, be satisfied in the long run. By turning the problem into an online convex-concave optimization problem, we propose an efficient algorithm which achieves O(root T) regret bound and O(T-3/4) bound on the violation of constraints. Then, we modify the algorithm in order to guarantee that the constraints are satisfied in the long run. This gain is achieved at the price of getting O(T-3/4) regret bound. Our second algorithm is based on the mirror prox method (Nemirovski, 2005) to solve variational inequalities which achieves O(T-2/3) bound for both regret and the violation of constraints when the domain K can be described by a finite number of linear constraints.

Characteristics of the training set, such as presence of noisy instances and size, influence the learning algorithm and affect generalization performance. This paper introduces a new network-based representation of a training set, called hit miss network (HMN), which provides a compact description of the nearest neighbor relation over pairs of instances from each pair of classes. We show that structural properties of HMN's correspond to properties of training points related to the one nearest neighbor (1-NN) decision rule, such as being border or central point. This motivates us to use HMN's for improving the performance of a 1-NN classifier by removing instances from the training set (instance selection). We introduce three new HMN-based algorithms for instance selection. HMN-C, which removes instances without affecting accuracy of 1-NN on the original training set, HMN-E, based on a more aggressive storage reduction, and HMN-EI, which applies iteratively HMN-E. Their performance is assessed on 22 data sets with different characteristics, such as input dimension, cardinality, class balance, number of classes, noise content, and presence of redundant variables. Results of experiments on these data sets show that accuracy of 1-NN classifier increases significantly when HMN-EI is applied. Comparison with state-of-the-art editing algorithms for instance selection on these data sets indicates best generalization performance of HMN-EI and no significant difference in storage requirements. In general, these results indicate that HMN's provide a powerful graph-based representation of a training set, which can be successfully applied for performing noise and redundance reduction in instance-based learning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,JUN,2008,9,,,,,,997,1017,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000258646300002,0

In order to process a local optimization technique, such as a gradient method, we wish to evaluate the sensitivity of the performance measure with respect to the policy parameters, the so-called policy gradient. This paper is concerned with the estimation of the policy gradient for continuous-time, deterministic state dynamics, in a reinforcement learning framework, that is, when the decision maker does not have a model of the state dynamics. We show that usual likelihood ratio methods used in discrete-time, fail to proceed the gradient because they are subject to variance explosion when the discretization time-step decreases to 0. We describe an alternative approach based on the approximation of the pathwise derivative, which leads to a policy gradient estimate that converges almost surely to the true gradient when the time-step tends to 0. The underlying idea starts with the derivation of an explicit representation of the policy gradient using pathwise derivation. This derivation makes use of the knowledge of the state dynamics. Then, in order to estimate the gradient from the observable data only, we use a stochastic policy to discretize the continuous deterministic system into a stochastic discrete process, which enables to replace the unknown coefficients by quantities that solely depend on known data. We prove the almost sure convergence of this estimate to the true policy gradient when the discretization time-step goes to zero.

Recent applications in text and speech processing and computational biology require however the analysis of variable-length sequences and more generally weighted automata. An approach widely used in statistical learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is that of kernel methods, due to their computational efficiency in high-dimensional feature spaces. We introduce a general family of kernels based on weighted transducers or rational relations, rational kernels, that extend kernel methods to the analysis of variable-length sequences or more generally weighted automata. We show that rational kernels can be computed efficiently using a general algorithm of composition of weighted transducers and a general single-source shortest-distance algorithm. Not all rational kernels are positive definite and symmetric (PDS), or equivalently verify the Mercer condition, a condition that guarantees the convergence of training for discriminant classification algorithms such as SVMs. We present several theoretical results related to PDS rational kernels. We show that under some general conditions these kernels are closed under sum, product, or Kleene-closure and give a general method for constructing a PDS rational kernel from an arbitrary transducer defined on some non-idempotent semirings. We give the proof of several characterization results that can be used to guide the design of PDS rational kernels. We also show that some commonly used string kernels or similarity measures such as the edit-distance, the convolution kernels of Haussler, and some string kernels used in the context of computational biology are specific instances of rational kernels. Our results include the proof that the edit-distance over a non-trivial alphabet is not negative definite, which, to the best of our knowledge, was never stated or proved before. Rational kernels can be combined with SVMs to form efficient and powerful techniques for a variety of classification tasks in text and speech processing, or computational biology.

Here, however, we focus on the case that the correct DGM is not on the model list and may not be well approximated by the elements on the model list. We give a sequence of computed examples by choosing model lists and DGM's to contrast the risk performance of stacking and BMA. In the first examples, the model lists are chosen to reflect geometric principles that should give good performance. In these cases, stacking typically outperforms BMA, sometimes by a wide margin. In the second set of examples we examine how stacking and BMA perform when the model list includes all subsets of a set of potential predictors. When we standardize the size of terms and coefficients in this setting, we find that BMA outperforms stacking when the deviant terms in the DGM 'point' in directions accommodated by the model list but that when the deviant term points outside the model list stacking seems to do better.

When following a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to approximate the posterior distribution in this context, one typically either uses MCMC schemes which target the joint posterior of the parameters and some auxiliary latent variables, or pseudo-marginal Metropolis-Hastings (MH) schemes. The latter mimic a MH algorithm targeting the marginal posterior of the parameters by approximating unbiasedly the intractable likelihood. However, in scenarios where the parameters and auxiliary variables are strongly correlated under the posterior and/or this posterior is multimodal, Gibbs sampling or Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) will perform poorly and the pseudo-marginal MH algorithm, as any other MH scheme, will be inefficient for high-dimensional parameters. We propose here an original MCMC algorithm, termed pseudo-marginal HMC, which combines the advantages of both HMC and pseudo-marginal schemes. Specifically, the PM-HMC method is controlled by a precision parameter N, controlling the approximation of the likelihood and, for any N, it samples the marginal posterior of the parameters. Additionally, as N tends to infinity, its sample trajectories and acceptance probability converge to those of an ideal, but intractable, HMC algorithm which would have access to the intractable likelihood and its gradient.

Stochastic proximal gradient methods have been widely used to solve such problems; however, their applicability remains limited when the problem dimension is large and the projection onto a convex set is computationally costly. Instead, stochastic conditional gradient algorithms are proposed as an alternative solution which rely on (i) Approximating gradients via a simple averaging technique requiring a single stochastic gradient evaluation per iteration; (ii) Solving a linear program to compute the descent/ascent direction. The gradient averaging technique reduces the noise of gradient approximations as time progresses, and replacing projection step in proximal methods by a linear program lowers the computational complexity of each iteration. We show that under convexity and smoothness assumptions, our proposed stochastic conditional gradient method converges to the optimal objective function value at a sublinear rate of O(1/t(1/3)). Further, for a monotone and continuous DR-submodular function and subject to a general convex body constraint, we prove that our proposed method achieves a ((1-1/e)OPT-epsilon) guarantee (in expectation) with O(1/epsilon(3)) stochastic gradient computations.

Although there is an extensive literature on latent feature allocation models for homogeneous datasets, where all the attributes that describe each object are of the same (continuous or discrete) type, there is no general framework for practical latent feature modeling for heterogeneous datasets. In this paper, we introduce a general Bayesian nonparametric latent feature allocation model suitable for heterogeneous datasets, where the attributes describing each object can be arbitrary combinations of real-valued, positive real-valued, categorical, ordinal and count variables. The proposed model presents several important properties. First, it is suitable for heterogeneous data while keeping the properties of conjugate models, which enables us to develop an inference algorithm that presents linear complexity with respect to the number of objects and attributes per MCMC iteration. Second, the Bayesian nonparametric component allows us to place a prior distribution on the number of features required to capture the latent structure in the data. Third, the latent features in the model are binary-valued, which facilitates the interpretability of the obtained latent features in exploratory data analysis. Finally, a software package, called GLFM toolbox, is made publicly available for other researchers to use and extend. It is available at https://ivaleram.github.io/GLFM/.

This is an important yet challenging problem for which, unlike optimizing an unknown function, existing methods face several limitations. In this paper, we present a novel constrained Bayesian optimization framework to optimize an unknown objective function subject to unknown constraints.

Topic models based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) successfully use the Dirichlet distribution as a prior for the topic and word distributions to enforce sparseness.

Sparsity is important for a low reconstruction error during training of the autoencoder, whereas smoothness enables generalization and leads to a better log-likelihood of the test data. Both of these properties are encoded in the Dirichlet parameter vector. By rewriting this parameter vector into a product of a sparse binary vector and a smoothness vector, we decouple the two properties, leading to a model that features both a competitive topic coherence and a high log-likelihood. Efficient training is enabled using rejection sampling variational inference for the reparameterization of the Dirichlet distribution.

In practice this takes a wide variety of different forms, and among them coresets are especially appealing. A coreset is a (small) weighted sample of the original data that comes with the following guarantee: a cost function can be evaluated on the smaller set instead of the larger one, with low relative error. For some classes of problems, and via a careful choice of sampling distribution (based on the so-called sensitivity metric), iid random sampling has turned to be one of the most successful methods for building coresets efficiently. However, independent samples are sometimes overly redundant, and one could hope that enforcing diversity would lead to better performance. The difficulty lies in proving coreset properties in non-iid samples. We show that the coreset property holds for samples formed with determinantal point processes (DPP). DPPs are interesting because they are a rare example of repulsive point processes with tractable theoretical properties, enabling us to prove general coreset theorems. We apply our results to both the k-means and the linear regression problems, and give extensive empirical evidence that the small additional computational cost of DPP sampling comes with superior performance over its iid counterpart.

This article considers data augmentation MCMC (DA-MCMC), a widely used technique. DA-MCMC samples tend to become highly autocorrelated in large samples, due to a mis-calibration problem in which conditional posterior distributions given augmented data are too concentrated. This makes it necessary to collect very long MCMC paths to obtain acceptably low MC error. To combat this inefficiency, we propose a family of calibrated data augmentation algorithms, which appropriately adjust the variance of conditional posterior distributions. A Metropolis-Hastings step is used to eliminate bias in the stationary distribution of the resulting sampler. Compared to existing alternatives, this approach can dramatically reduce MC error by reducing autocorrelation and increasing the effective number of DA-MCMC samples per unit of computing time.

After clustering is applied, the most fundamental analysis is to quantitatively compare clusterings. Such comparisons are crucial for the evaluation of clustering methods as well as other tasks such as consensus clustering. It is often argued that, in order to establish a baseline, clustering similarity should be assessed in the context of a random ensemble of clusterings. The prevailing assumption for the random clustering ensemble is the permutation model in which the number and sizes of clusters are fixed. However, this assumption does not necessarily hold in practice; for example, multiple runs of K-means clustering returns clusterings with a fixed number of clusters, while the cluster size distribution varies greatly. Here, we derive corrected variants of two clustering similarity measures (the Rand index and Mutual Information) in the context of two random clustering ensembles in which the number and sizes of clusters vary. In addition, we study the impact of one-sided comparisons in the scenario with a reference clustering. The consequences of different random models are illustrated using synthetic examples, handwriting recognition, and gene expression data. We demonstrate that the choice of random model can have a drastic impact on the ranking of similar clustering pairs, and the evaluation of a clustering method with respect to a random baseline; thus, the choice of random clustering model should be carefully justified.",,,,,"Ahn, Yong-Yeol/C-6334-2011","Ahn, Yong-Yeol/0000-0002-4352-4301",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2017,18,,,,,,,,87,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000412069900001,0

Unfortunately, the expressiveness of PSRs comes with significant computational cost, and this cost is a major factor inhibiting the use of PSRs in applications. In order to alleviate this shortcoming, we introduce the notion of compressed PSRs (CPSRs).

However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size is an element of and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L.

We show that after N iterations, with a constant step-size proportional to 1/R-2 root N where N is the number of observations and R is the maximum norm of the observations, the convergence rate is always of order O(1/root N), and improves to O (R-2/mu N) where mu is the lowest eigenvalue of the Hessian at the global optimum (when this eigenvalue is greater than R-2/root N). Since mu does not need to be known in advance, this shows that averaged stochastic gradient is adaptive to unknown local strong convexity of the objective function. Our proof relies on the generalized self-concordance properties of the logistic loss and thus extends to all generalized linear models with uniformly bounded features.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,FEB,2014,15,,,,,,595,627,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000335457700008,0

They have one parameter: the ground metric, which can be any metric between the features themselves. As is the case for all parameterized distances, optimal transport distances can only prove useful in practice when this parameter is carefully chosen. To date, the only option available to practitioners to set the ground metric parameter was to rely on a priori knowledge of the features, which limited considerably the scope of application of optimal transport distances. We propose to lift this limitation and consider instead algorithms that can learn the ground metric using only a training set of labeled histograms. We call this approach ground metric learning. We formulate the problem of learning the ground metric as the minimization of the difference of two convex polyhedral functions over a convex set of metric matrices.

Recently, sparse recovery methods were shown to provide a provable and robust strategy for exact feature selection (EFS)-recovering subsets of points from the ensemble that live in the same subspace. In parallel with recent studies of EFS with l(1)-minimization, in this paper, we develop sufficient conditions for EFS with a greedy method for sparse signal recovery known as orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP). Following our analysis, we provide an empirical study of feature selection strategies for signals living on unions of subspaces and characterize the gap between sparse recovery methods and nearest neighbor (NN)-based approaches. In particular, we demonstrate that sparse recovery methods provide significant advantages over NN methods and that the gap between the two approaches is particularly pronounced when the sampling of subspaces in the data set is sparse.

Our focus is on random walk kernels, the analogues of squared exponential kernels in Euclidean spaces. We show that on large, locally treelike graphs these have some counter-intuitive properties, specifically in the limit of large kernel lengthscales. We consider using these kernels as covariance functions of Gaussian processes. In this situation one typically scales the prior globally to normalise the average of the prior variance across vertices. We demonstrate that, in contrast to the Euclidean case, this generically leads to significant variation in the prior variance across vertices, which is undesirable from a probabilistic modelling point of view. We suggest the random walk kernel should be normalised locally, so that each vertex has the same prior variance, and analyse the consequences of this by studying learning curves for Gaussian process regression.

Once a gesture is selected, MAGIC can output synthetic examples of the gesture to train a chosen classifier (for example, with a hidden Markov model).

Learning a valid Mahalanobis distance metric requires enforcing the constraint that the matrix parameter to the metric remains positive semidefinite. Semidefinite programming is often used to enforce this constraint, but does not scale well and is not easy to implement.

BOOSTMETRIC thus uses rank-one positive semidefinite matrices as weak learners within an efficient and scalable boosting-based learning process. The resulting methods are easy to implement, efficient, and can accommodate various types of constraints.

The error of such an estimator can be broken down into bias and variance components. While unbiasedness is often cited as a beneficial quality of a model selection criterion, we demonstrate that a low variance is at least as important, as a non-negligible variance introduces the potential for over-fitting in model selection as well as in training the model. While this observation is in hindsight perhaps rather obvious, the degradation in performance due to over-fitting the model selection criterion can be surprisingly large, an observation that appears to have received little attention in the machine learning literature to date. In this paper, we show that the effects of this form of over-fitting are often of comparable magnitude to differences in performance between learning algorithms, and thus cannot be ignored in empirical evaluation. Furthermore, we show that some common performance evaluation practices are susceptible to a form of selection bias as a result of this form of over-fitting and hence are unreliable. We discuss methods to avoid over-fitting in model selection and subsequent selection bias in performance evaluation, which we hope will be incorporated into best practice. While this study concentrates on cross-validation based model selection, the findings are quite general and apply to any model selection practice involving the optimisation of a model selection criterion evaluated over a finite sample of data, including maximisation of the Bayesian evidence and optimisation of performance bounds.",,,,,,"Cawley, Gavin/0000-0002-4118-9095",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,JUL,2010,11,,,,,,2079,2107,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000282523000006,0

In contrast, the notion of algorithmic stability can be used to derive tight generalization bounds that are tailored to specific learning algorithms by exploiting their particular properties. However, as in much of learning theory, existing stability analyses and bounds apply only in the scenario where the samples are independently and identically distributed. In many machine learning applications, however, this assumption does not hold. The observations received by the learning algorithm often have some inherent temporal dependence. This paper studies the scenario where the observations are drawn from a stationary phi-mixing or beta-mixing sequence, a widely adopted assumption in the study of non-i.i.d. processes that implies a dependence between observations weakening over time. We prove novel and distinct stability-based generalization bounds for stationary phi-mixing and beta-mixing sequences. These bounds strictly generalize the bounds given in the i.i.d. case and apply to all stable learning algorithms, thereby extending the use of stability-bounds to non-i.i.d. scenarios. We also illustrate the application of our phi-mixing generalization bounds to general classes of learning algorithms, including Support Vector Regression, Kernel Ridge Regression, and Support Vector Machines, and many other kernel regularization-based and relative entropy-based regularization algorithms. These novel bounds can thus be viewed as the first theoretical basis for the use of these algorithms in non-i.i.d. scenarios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,FEB,2010,11,,,,,,789,814,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000277186500014,0

The resulting algorithms are sound under well-defined sufficient conditions. In a first set of experiments we evaluate several algorithms derived from this framework in terms of predictivity and feature set parsimony and compare to other local causal discovery methods and to state-of-the-art non-causal feature selection methods using real data. A second set of experimental evaluations compares the algorithms in terms of ability to induce local causal neighborhoods using simulated and resimulated data and examines the relation of predictivity with causal induction performance. Our experiments demonstrate, consistently with causal feature selection theory, that local causal feature selection methods (under broad assumptions encompassing appropriate family of distributions, types of classifiers, and loss functions) exhibit strong feature set parsimony, high predictivity and local causal interpretability. Although non-causal feature selection methods are often used in practice to shed light on causal relationships, we find that they cannot be interpreted causally even when they achieve excellent predictivity. Therefore we conclude that only local causal techniques should be used when insight into causal structure is sought.

The RPR is a parametric model of the conditional distribution over current actions given the history of past actions and observations; the agent's choice of actions is directly based on this conditional distribution, without an intervening model to characterize the environment itself. We propose off-policy batch algorithms to learn the parameters of the RPRs, using episodic data collected when following a behavior policy, and show their linkage to policy iteration. We employ the Dirichlet process as a nonparametric prior over the RPRs across multiple environments. The intrinsic clustering property of the Dirichlet process imposes sharing of episodes among similar environments, which effectively reduces the number of episodes required for learning a good policy in each environment, when data sharing is appropriate. The number of distinct RPRs and the associated clusters (the sharing patterns) are automatically discovered by exploiting the episodic data as well as the nonparametric nature of the Dirichlet process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RPR as well as the RPR-based MTRL framework on various problems, including grid-world navigation and multi-aspect target classification.

The impressive performance can be attributed to progress in computing domain independent heuristics that perform well across many domains. However, it is easy to find domains where such heuristics provide poor guidance, leading to planning failure. Motivated by such failures, the focus of this paper is to investigate mechanisms for learning domain-specific knowledge to better control forward search in a given domain. While there has been a large body of work on inductive learning of control knowledge for AI planning, there is a void of work aimed at forward-state-space search. One reason for this may be that it is challenging to specify a knowledge representation for compactly representing important concepts across a wide range of domains. One of the main contributions of this work is to introduce a novel feature space for representing such control knowledge. The key idea is to define features in terms of information computed via relaxed plan extraction, which has been a major source of success for non-learning planners. This gives a new way of leveraging relaxed planning techniques in the context of learning. Using this feature space, we describe three forms of control knowledge-reactive policies (decision list rules and measures of progress) and linear heuristics-and show how to learn them and incorporate them into forward state-space search. Our empirical results show that our approaches are able to surpass state-of-the-art non-learning planners across a wide range of planning competition domains.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,APR,2008,9,,,,,,683,718,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000256642100006,0

Nevertheless, most existing algorithms are limited to combining only a finite number of hypotheses, and the generated ensemble is usually sparse. Thus, it is not clear whether we should construct an ensemble classifier with a larger or even an infinite number of hypotheses. In addition, constructing an infinite ensemble itself is a challenging task. In this paper, we formulate an infinite ensemble learning framework based on the support vector machine (SVM). The framework can output an infinite and nonsparse ensemble through embedding infinitely many hypotheses into an SVM kernel. We use the framework to derive two novel kernels, the stump kernel and the perceptron kernel. The stump kernel embodies infinitely many decision stumps, and the perceptron kernel embodies infinitely many perceptrons. We also show that the Laplacian radial basis function kernel embodies infinitely many decision trees, and can thus be explained through infinite ensemble learning. Experimental results show that SVM with these kernels is superior to boosting with the same base hypothesis set. In addition, SVM with the stump kernel or the perceptron kernel performs similarly to SVM with the Gaussian radial basis function kernel, but enjoys the benefit of faster parameter selection.

Geometrically, this implies allowing arbitrary signal distortions in an n-dimensional rectangle defined by the e-insensitivity zone in each dimension of the selected image representation domain. Unfortunately, not every image representation domain is well-suited for such a simple, scalar-wise, approach because statistical and/or perceptual interactions between the coefficients may exist. These interactions imply that scalar approaches may induce distortions that do not follow the image statistics and/or are perceptually annoying. Taking into account these relations would imply using non-rectangular epsilon-insensitivity regions (allowing coupled distortions in different coefficients), which is beyond the conventional SVM formulation. In this paper, we report a condition on the suitable domain for developing efficient SVM image coding schemes. We analytically demonstrate that no linear domain fulfills this condition because of the statistical and perceptual inter-coefficient relations that exist in these domains. This theoretical result is experimentally confirmed by comparing SVM learning in previously reported linear domains and in a recently proposed non-linear perceptual domain that simultaneously reduces the statistical and perceptual relations (so it is closer to fulfilling the proposed condition).

This can result in substantial reduction in kernel data-dependence (over 94% in six of the seven public datasets tested on) and with test set correctness equal to that obtained by using a conventional support vector machine classifier that depends on many more data points. This reduction in data dependence results in a much faster classifier that requires less storage. To eliminate data points, the proposed approach makes use of a novel loss function, the pound function ((.)-)(#), which is a linear combination of the 1-norm and the step function that measures both the magnitude and the presence of any error.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,Feb-15,2003,3,2,,,,,303,321,,10.1162/153244303765208403,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000182488500005,0

Originally motivated by pursuing a theoretical understanding of the maximum correntropy criterion based regression (MCCR), our study reveals that MCCR with a tending-to-zero scale parameter is essentially modal regression. We show that the nonparametric modal regression problem can be approached via the classical empirical risk minimization. Some efforts are then made to develop a framework for analyzing and implementing modal regression. For instance, the modal regression function is described, the modal regression risk is defined explicitly and its Bayes rule is characterized; for the sake of computational tractability, the surrogate modal regression risk, which is termed as the generalization risk in our study, is introduced. On the theoretical side, the excess modal regression risk, the excess generalization risk, the function estimation error, and the relations among the above three quantities are studied rigorously. It turns out that under mild conditions, function estimation consistency and convergence may be pursued in modal regression as in vanilla regression protocols such as mean regression, median regression, and quantile regression. On the practical side, the implementation issues of modal regression including the computational algorithm and the selection of the tuning parameters are discussed.

In practical applications it is therefore fundamental to investigate the robustness of a statistical model to misspecification of some of its underlying probabilities. In the context of graphical models, investigations of robustness fall under the notion of sensitivity analyses. These analyses consist in varying some of the model's probabilities or parameters and then assessing how far apart the original and the varied distributions are. However, for Gaussian graphical models, such variations usually make the original graph an incoherent representation of the model's conditional independence structure. Here we develop an approach to sensitivity analysis which guarantees the original graph remains valid after any probability variation and we quantify the effect of such variations using different measures. To achieve this we take advantage of algebraic techniques to both concisely represent conditional independence and to provide a straightforward way of checking the validity of such relationships.

The divide-and-conquer approach is employed, so there is no inter-node communication overhead. Similar as other distributed algorithms, DMEE significantly reduces the computational complexity and memory requirement on single computing nodes. With fully supervised data, our proved learning rates equal the minimax optimal learning rates of the classical pointwise kernel-based regressions. Under the semi-supervised learning scenarios, we show that DMEE exploits unlabeled data effectively, in the sense that first, under the settings with weak regularity assumptions, additional unlabeled data significantly improves the learning rates of DMEE. Second, with sufficient unlabeled data, labeled data can be distributed to many more computing nodes, that each node takes only O(1) labels, without spoiling the learning rates in terms of the number of labels. This conclusion overcomes the saturation phenomenon in unlabeled data size. It parallels a recent results for regularized least squares (Lin and Zhou, 2018), and suggests that an inflation of unlabeled data is a solution to the MEE learning problems with decentralized data source for the concerns of privacy protection.

The approach is particularly appealing to uncover the complex heterogeneity in high-dimensional data, incorporate nonlinearity and potential interaction, avoid the curse of dimensionality, and allow different variables to be included at different quantile levels. We estimate the unknown function via polynomial splines nonparametrically and adopt a nonconvex penalty function to identify the sparse variable set. We further extend it to partially linear single-index quantile model where both the single-index components in the nonparametric term and the partially linear components can be in ultra-high dimension. However, a number of major challenges arise in developing both theory and computation: (a) The model is highly nonlinear in single-index coefficients because the high-dimensional single-index covariates are embedded inside the unknown flexible function. (b) The data are ultra-high dimensional where the dimension of the single-index covariates (p(n)) is diverging or even in the exponential order of sample size n.

Specifically, we propose a variant of the Best Arm Identification problem for contaminated bandits, where each arm pull has probability epsilon of generating a sample from an arbitrary contamination distribution instead of the true underlying distribution. The goal is to identify the best (or approximately best) true distribution with high probability, with a secondary goal of providing guarantees on the quality of this distribution. The primary challenge of the contaminated bandit setting is that the true distributions are only partially identifiable, even with infinite samples. To address this, we develop tight, non-asymptotic sample complexity bounds for high-probability estimation of the first two robust moments (median and median absolute deviation) from contaminated samples. These concentration inequalities are the main technical contributions of the paper and may be of independent interest. Using these results, we adapt several classical Best Arm Identification algorithms to the contaminated bandit setting and derive sample complexity upper bounds for our problem. Finally, we provide matching information-theoretic lower bounds on the sample complexity (up to a small logarithmic factor).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2019,20,,,,,,,,91,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000470907900001,0

A DRM is a deep network in which the input layer consists of Boolean-valued functions (features) that are defined in terms of relations provided as domain, or background, knowledge. Our DRMs differ from those in Lodhi (2013), which uses an Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) engine to first select features (we use random selections from a space of features that satisfies some approximate constraints on logical relevance and non-redundancy). But why do the DRMs predict what they do? One way of answering this was provided in recent work Ribeiro et al. (2016), by constructing readable proxies for a black-box predictor. The proxies are intended only to model the predictions of the black-box in local regions of the instance-space. But readability alone may not be enough: to be understandable, the local models must use relevant concepts in an meaningful manner. We investigate the use of a Bayes-like approach to identify logical proxies for local predictions of a DRM. As a preliminary step, we show that DRM's with our randomised propositionalization method achieve predictive performance that is comparable to the best reports in the ILP literature. Our principal results on logical explanations show: (a) Models in first-order logic can approximate the DRM's prediction closely in a small local region; and (b) Expert-provided relevance information can play the role of a prior to distinguish between logical explanations that perform equivalently on prediction alone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2019,20,,,,,,,,130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000487068900014,0

In this paper, we propose a new method for the derivative estimation using the locally weighted least absolute deviation regression. Different from the local polynomial regression, the proposed method does not require a finite variance for the error term and so is robust to the presence of heavy-tailed errors. Meanwhile, it does not require a zero median or a positive density at zero for the error term in comparison with the local median regression. We further show that the proposed estimator with random difference is asymptotically equivalent to the (infinitely) composite quantile regression estimator. In other words, running one regression is equivalent to combining infinitely many quantile regressions. In addition, the proposed method is also extended to estimate the derivatives at the boundaries and to estimate higher-order derivatives. For the equidistant design, we derive theoretical results for the proposed estimators, including the asymptotic bias and variance, consistency, and asymptotic normality. Finally, we conduct simulation studies to demonstrate that the proposed method has better performance than the existing methods in the presence of outliers and heavy-tailed errors, and analyze the Chinese house price data for the past ten years to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method.",,,,,"Tong, Tiejun/F-3880-2010","Tong, Tiejun/0000-0003-0947-3990",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2019,20,,,,,,,,60,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000467878700001,0

To alleviate these issues, preference-based reinforcement learning algorithms (PbRL) have been proposed that can directly learn from an expert's preferences instead of a hand-designed numeric reward. PbRL has gained traction in recent years due to its ability to resolve the reward shaping problem, its ability to learn from non numeric rewards and the possibility to reduce the dependence on expert knowledge.

Different from existing theory for SVM which has been mainly focused on the generalization error rates and empirical risk, we study the asymptotic behavior of the coefficients of L-1-norm SVM.

Focusing on the latter criterion, our first main result provides a general lower bound on any randomized method that sketches both the data matrix and vector in a least-squares problem; as a surprising consequence, the most widely used least-squares sketch is sub-optimal for solution approximation.

This optimization framework gives insight to some rarely discussed shortcomings of well-known methods, such as the suboptimality of certain eigenvector solutions. Modern techniques for optimization over matrix manifolds enable a generic linear dimensionality reduction solver, which accepts as input data and an objective to be optimized, and returns, as output, an optimal low-dimensional projection of the data.

The VAR model poses some unique challenges to researchers: On one hand, the dimensionality, introduced by incorporating multiple numbers of time series and adding the order of the vector autoregression, is usually much higher than the time series length; On the other hand, the temporal dependence structure naturally present in the VAR model gives rise to extra difficulties in data analysis. The regular way in cracking the VAR model is via least squares and usually involves adding different penalty terms (e.g., ridge or lasso penalty) in handling high dimensionality. In this manuscript, we propose an alternative way in estimating the VAR model. The main idea is, via exploiting the temporal dependence structure, formulating the estimating problem to a linear program. There is instant advantage of the proposed approach over the lasso type estimators: The estimation equation can be decomposed to multiple sub-equations and accordingly can be solved efficiently using parallel computing. Besides that, we also bring new theoretical insights into the VAR model analysis. So far the theoretical results developed in high dimensions (e.g., Song and Bickel, 2011 and Kock and Callot, 2015) are based on stringent assumptions that are not transparent. Our results, on the other hand, show that the spectral norms of the transition matrices play an important role in estimation accuracy and build estimation and prediction consistency accordingly.

As in standard sparse coding, the model used assumes independent latent sources that linearly combine to generate data points. However, instead of using a standard sparse prior such as a Laplace distribution, we study the application of a more flexible 'spike-and-slab' distribution which models the absence or presence of a source's contribution independently of its strength if it contributes. We investigate two approaches to optimize the parameters of spike-and-slab sparse coding: a novel truncated EM approach and, for comparison, an approach based on standard factored variational distributions. The truncated approach can be regarded as a variational approach with truncated posteriors as variational distributions. In applications to source separation we find that both approaches improve the state-of-the-art in a number of standard benchmarks, which argues for the use of 'spike-and-slab' priors for the corresponding data domains. Furthermore, we find that the truncated EM approach improves on the standard factored approach in source separation tasks-which hints to biases introduced by assuming posterior independence in the factored variational approach.

Recent work on max-margin supervised topic models has successfully integrated it with Bayesian topic models to discover discriminative latent semantic structures and make accurate predictions for unseen testing data. However, the resulting learning problems are usually hard to solve because of the non-smoothness of the margin loss. Existing approaches to building max-margin supervised topic models rely on an iterative procedure to solve multiple latent SVM subproblems with additional mean-field assumptions on the desired posterior distributions. This paper presents an alternative approach by defining a new max-margin loss. Namely, we present Gibbs max-margin supervised topic models, a latent variable Gibbs classifier to discover hidden topic representations for various tasks, including classification, regression and multi-task learning. Gibbs max-margin supervised topic models minimize an expected margin loss, which is an upper bound of the existing margin loss derived from an expected prediction rule.

Furthermore, each step of the augment-and-collapse Gibbs sampling algorithms has an analytical conditional distribution, from which samples can be easily drawn.

If the signal has a characteristic timescale relevant to future prediction, the memory can be a simple shift register-a moving window extending into the past, requiring storage resources that linearly grows with the timescale to be represented. However, an independent general purpose learner cannot a priori know the characteristic prediction-relevant timescale of the signal. Moreover, many naturally occurring signals show scale-free long range correlations implying that the natural prediction-relevant timescale is essentially unbounded. Hence the learner should maintain information from the longest possible timescale allowed by resource availability. Here we construct a fuzzy memory system that optimally sacrifices the temporal accuracy of information in a scale-free fashion in order to represent prediction-relevant information from exponentially long timescales. Using several illustrative examples, we demonstrate the advantage of the fuzzy memory system over a shift register in time series forecasting of natural signals. When the available storage resources are limited, we suggest that a general purpose learner would be better off committing to such a fuzzy memory system.",,,,,"Howard, Marc/E-2518-2012",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,DEC,2013,14,,,,,,3785,3812,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000335457100010,0

Unfortunately, marginal MAP can be NP-hard even on trees, and has attracted less attention in the literature compared to the joint MAP (maximization) and marginalization problems. We derive a general dual representation for marginal MAP that naturally integrates the marginalization and maximization operations into a joint variational optimization problem, making it possible to easily extend most or all variational-based algorithms to marginal MAP. In particular, we derive a set of mixed-product message passing algorithms for marginal MAP, whose form is a hybrid of max-product, sum-product and a novel argmax-product message updates. We also derive a class of convergent algorithms based on proximal point methods, including one that transforms the marginal MAP problem into a sequence of standard marginalization problems.

LMM improves the assessment of candidate edges by using a ranking criterion that considers conditional independence on neighboring variables at both sides of an edge simultaneously. The algorithm also employs an adaptive relaxation of constraints that, selectively, allows some nodes not to condition on some neighbors. This relaxation aims at reducing the incorrect rejection of true edges connecting high degree nodes due to multiple testing.

However, existing supervised topic models predominantly employ likelihood-driven objective functions for learning and inference, leaving the popular and potentially powerful max-margin principle unexploited for seeking predictive representations of data and more discriminative topic bases for the corpus. In this paper, we propose the maximum entropy discrimination latent Dirichlet allocation (MedLDA) model, which integrates the mechanism behind the max-margin prediction models (e.g., SVMs) with the mechanism behind the hierarchical Bayesian topic models (e.g., LDA) under a unified constrained optimization framework, and yields latent topical representations that are more discriminative and more suitable for prediction tasks such as document classification or regression. The principle underlying the MedLDA formalism is quite general and can be applied for jointly max-margin and maximum likelihood learning of directed or undirected topic models when supervising side information is available. Efficient variational methods for posterior inference and parameter estimation are derived and extensive empirical studies on several real data sets are also provided.

Algorithms for various signal processing applications, including classification, denoising and signal separation, learn a dictionary from a given set of signals to be represented. Can we expect that the error in representing by such a dictionary a previously unseen signal from the same source will be of similar magnitude as those for the given examples? We assume signals are generated from a fixed distribution, and study these questions from a statistical learning theory perspective. We develop generalization bounds on the quality of the learned dictionary for two types of constraints on the coefficient selection, as measured by the expected L-2 error in representation when the dictionary is used. For the case of l(1) regularized coefficient selection we provide a generalization bound of the order of O(root npln(m lambda)/m), where n is the dimension, p is the number of elements in the dictionary, l is a bound on the l(1) norm of the coefficient vector and m is the number of samples, which complements existing results. For the case of representing a new signal as a combination of at most k dictionary elements, we provide a bound of the order O(root npln(mk)/m) under an assumption on the closeness to orthogonality of the dictionary (low Babel function). We further show that this assumption holds for most dictionaries in high dimensions in a strong probabilistic sense.

The bottleneck of the problem is the memory requirement, and therefore, the algorithm is currently applicable for up to a few tens of nodes. While the recently proposed algorithm overcomes this limitation by a space-time trade-off, our proposed algorithm realizes direct parallelization of the original DP algorithm with O(n(sigma)) time and space overhead calculations, where sigma > 0 controls the communication-space trade-off. The overall time and space complexity is O(n(sigma+1)2(n)). This algorithm splits the search space so that the required communication between independent calculations is minimal. Because of this advantage, our algorithm can run on distributed memory supercomputers. Through computational experiments, we confirmed that our algorithm can run in parallel using up to 256 processors with a parallelization efficiency of 0.74, compared to the original DP algorithm with a single processor.

The assumptions made in module networks, dynamic Bayes nets and context specific independence models can be viewed as particular cases of such parameter constraints. We present closed form solutions or fast iterative algorithms for estimating parameters subject to several specific classes of parameter constraints, including equalities and inequalities among parameters, constraints on individual parameters, and constraints on sums and ratios of parameters, for discrete and continuous variables. Our methods cover learning from both frequentist and Bayesian points of view, from both complete and incomplete data. We present formal guarantees for our estimators, as well as methods for automatically learning useful parameter constraints from data. To validate our approach, we apply it to the domain of fMRI brain image analysis. Here we demonstrate the ability of our system to first learn useful relationships among parameters, and then to use them to constrain the training of the Bayesian network, resulting in improved cross-validated accuracy of the learned model.

Our technique maps intracranial electroencephalogram (EEG) time series into corresponding novelty sequences by classifying short-time, energy-based statistics computed from one-second windows of data. We train a classifier on epochs of interictal (normal) EEG. During ictal (seizure) epochs of EEG, seizure activity induces distributional changes in feature space that increase the empirical outlier fraction. A hypothesis test determines when the parameter change differs significantly from its nominal value, signaling a seizure detection event. Outputs are gated in a one-shot manner using persistence to reduce the false alarm rate of the system. The detector was validated using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) on a sample of 41 interictal and 29 ictal epochs, and achieved 97.1% sensitivity, a mean detection latency of -7.58 seconds, and an asymptotic false positive rate (FPR) of 1.56 false positives per hour (Fp/hr). These results are better than those obtained from a novelty detection technique based on Mahalanobis distance outlier detection, and comparable to the performance of a supervised learning technique used in experimental implantable devices (Echauz et al., 2001). The novelty detection paradigm overcomes three significant limitations of competing methods: the need to collect seizure data, precisely mark seizure onset and offset times, and perform patient-specific parameter tuning for detector training.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,JUN,2006,7,,,,,,1025,1044,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000245388400006,0

These algorithms employ a two-stage process where the first stage produces an approximate solution to a dual QP problem and the second stage maps this approximate dual solution to an approximate primal solution. For the second stage we describe an O(n log n) algorithm that maps an approximate dual solution with accuracy (2 root 2K(n) + 8 root lambda)(-2) lambda epsilon(2)(p) to an approximate primal solution with accuracy epsilon(p) where n is the number of data samples, K-n is the maximum kernel value over the data and lambda > 0 is the SVM regularization parameter. For the first stage we present new results for decomposition algorithms and describe new decomposition algorithms with guaranteed accuracy and run time. In particular, for tau-rate certifying decomposition algorithms we establish the optimality of tau = 1/(n - 1). In addition we extend the recent tau = 1/(n - 1) algorithm of Simon ( 2004) to form two new composite algorithms that also achieve the t = 1/( n- 1) iteration bound of List and Simon ( 2005), but yield faster run times in practice. We also exploit the t - rate certifying property of these algorithms to produce new stopping rules that are computationally efficient and that guarantee a specified accuracy for the approximate dual solution. Furthermore, for the dual QP problem corresponding to the standard classification problem we describe operational conditions for which the Simon and composite algorithms possess an upper bound of O(n) on the number of iterations. For this same problem we also describe general conditions for which a matching lower bound exists for any decomposition algorithm that uses working sets of size 2. For the Simon and composite algorithms we also establish an O(n(2)) bound on the overall run time for the first stage. Combining the first and second stages gives an overall run time of O(n(2)(c(k) + 1)) where c(k) is an upper bound on the computation to perform a kernel evaluation. Pseudocode is presented for a complete algorithm that inputs an accuracy epsilon(p) and produces an approximate solution that satisfies this accuracy in low order polynomial time.

Key to the model is that we assume that once the system switches from the normal to the prefault regime it cannot restore and will eventually result in a fault. We refer to the particular setting as semi-supervised since we assume the only information given to the learner is whether a particular sequence ended with a stop (implying that the sequence was generated by the normal regime) or with a fault (implying that there was a switch from the normal to the fault regime). In the latter case the particular time point at which a switch occurred is not known. The underlying model used is a switching linear dynamical system (SLDS). The constraints in the regime transition probabilities result in an exact inference procedure that scales quadratically with the length of a sequence. Maximum aposteriori (MAP) parameter estimates can be found using an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm with this inference algorithm in the E-step. For long sequences this will not be practically feasible and an approximate inference and an approximate EM procedure is called for.

The approach is based on the observation that the computational cost of learning a model increases as a function of the sample size of the training data, whereas the accuracy of a model has diminishing improvements as a function of sample size. Thus, the learning-curve sampling method monitors the increasing costs and performance as larger and larger amounts of data are used for training, and terminates learning when future costs outweigh future benefits. In this paper, we formalize the learning-curve sampling method and its associated cost-benefit tradeoff in terms of decision theory. In addition, we describe the application of the learning-curve sampling method to the task of model-based clustering via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. In experiments on three real data sets, we show that the learning-curve sampling method produces models that are nearly as accurate as those trained on complete data sets, but with dramatically reduced learning times. Finally, we describe an extension of the basic learning-curve approach for model-based clustering that results in an additional speedup. This extension is based on the observation that the shape of the learning curve for a given model and data set is roughly independent of the number of EM iterations used during training.

In various applications, ranging from industrial quality control to public health through credit risk analysis for instance, training observations can be right censored, meaning that, rather than on independent copies of (X, Y), statistical learning relies on a collection of n >= 1 independent realizations of the triplet (X, min{Y, C}, delta), where C is a nonnegative random variable with unknown distribution, modelling censoring and delta = I{Y <= C} indicates whether the duration is right censored or not. As ignoring censoring in the risk computation may clearly lead to a severe underestimation of the target duration and jeopardize prediction, we consider a plug-in estimate of the true risk based on a Kaplan-Meier estimator of the conditional survival function of the censoring C given X, referred to as Reran risk, in order to perform empirical risk minimization. It is established, under mild conditions, that the learning rate of minimizers of this biased/weighted empirical risk functional is of order O-p(root log(n)/n) when ignoring model bias issues inherent to plug-in estimation, as can be attained in absence of censoring.

An interesting concept is known as the local minimax point (Jin et al., 2020), which strongly correlates with the widely-known gradient descent ascent algorithm. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of local minimax points, such as their relation with other solution concepts and their optimality conditions. We find that local saddle points can be regarded as a special type of local minimax points, called uniformly local minimax points, under mild continuity assumptions. In (non-convex) quadratic games, we show that local minimax points are (in some sense) equivalent to global minimax points. Finally, we study the stability of gradient algorithms near local minimax points.

We show that these two definitions can have drastically different implications when the principal needs to learn the utility model. Linear regret relative to optimal individually fair decisions is generally unavoidable under FT.

However, kernel k-means clustering is computationally expensive when the non-linear feature map is high-dimensional and there are many input points. Kernel approximation, e.g., the Nystrom method, has been applied in previous works to approximately solve kernel learning problems when both of the above conditions are present. This work analyzes the application of this paradigm to kernel k-means clustering, and shows that applying the linear k-means clustering algorithm to k/c(1 + o(1)) features constructed using a so-called rank-restricted Nystrom approximation results in cluster assignments that satisfy a 1+ epsilon approximation ratio in terms of the kernel k-means cost function, relative to the guarantee provided by the same algorithm without the use of the Nystrom method. As part of the analysis, this work establishes a novel 1+ epsilon relative-error trace norm guarantee for low-rank approximation using the rank-restricted Nystrom approximation. Empirical evaluations on the 8 : 1 million instance MNIST8M dataset demonstrate the scalability and usefulness of kernel k-means clustering with Nystrom approximation. This work argues that spectral clustering using Nystrom approximation a popular and computationally efficient, but theoretically unsound approach to non-linear clustering-should be replaced with the efficient and theoretically sound combination of kernel k-means clustering with Nystrom approximation. The superior performance of the latter approach is empirically verified.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2019,20,,,,,,,,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000458665700001,0

The distributed inference algorithm involves only local computation of the information matrix and of the mean vector, and message passing between neighbors. Under broad conditions, it is shown that the message information matrix converges to a unique positive definite limit matrix for arbitrary positive semidefinite initialization, and it approaches an arbitrarily small neighborhood of this limit matrix at an exponential rate. A necessary and sufficient convergence condition for the belief mean vector to converge to the optimal centralized estimator is provided under the assumption that the message information matrix is initialized as a positive semidefinite matrix. Further, it is shown that Gaussian BP always converges when the underlying factor graph is given by the union of a forest and a single loop.

Although the SGD iteration is computationally cheap and its practical performance may be satisfactory under certain circumstances, there is recent evidence of its convergence difficulties and instability for unappropriate choice of parameters. To avoid some of the drawbacks of SGD, stochastic proximal point (SPP) algorithms have been recently considered. We introduce a new variant of the SPP method for solving stochastic convex problems subject to (in)finite intersection of constraints satisfying a linear regularity condition. For the newly introduced SPP scheme we prove new nonasymptotic convergence results. In particular, for convex Lipschitz continuous objective functions, we prove nonasymptotic convergence rates in terms of the expected value function gap of order O(1/k(1/2)) where k is the iteration counter. We also derive better nonasymptotic convergence rates in terms of expected quadratic distance from the iterates to the optimal solution for smooth strongly convex objective functions, which in the best case is of order O(1/k). Since these convergence rates can be attained by our SPP algorithm only under some natural restrictions on the stepsize, we also introduce a restarting variant of SPP that overcomes these difficulties and derive the corresponding nonasymptotic convergence rates.

We motivate our work from the hypothesis that, there is a training barrier involved in the nature of such tasks, and that humans learn useful intermediate concepts from other individuals by using a form of supervision or guidance using a curriculum. Our results provide a positive evidence in favor of this hypothesis. In our experiments, we trained a two-tiered MLP architecture on a dataset for which each input image contains three sprites, and the binary target class is 1 if all of three shapes belong to the same category and otherwise the class is 0. In terms of generalization, black-box machine learning algorithms could not perform better than chance on this task. Standard deep supervised neural networks also failed to generalize. However, using a particular structure and guiding the learner by providing intermediate targets in the form of intermediate concepts (the presence of each object) allowed us to solve the task efficiently. We obtained much better than chance, but imperfect results by exploring different architectures and optimization variants. This observation might be an indication of optimization difficulty when the neural network trained without hints on this task.

Although there is a rich literature on methods for allowing the variance in a univariate regression model to vary with predictors, relatively little has been done in the multivariate case. As a motivating example, we consider the Google Flu Trends data set, which provides indirect measurements of influenza incidence at a large set of locations over time (our predictor). To accurately characterize temporally evolving influenza incidence across regions, it is important to develop statistical methods for a time-varying covariance matrix. Importantly, the locations provide a redundant set of measurements and do not yield a sparse nor static spatial dependence structure. We propose to reduce dimensionality and induce a flexible Bayesian nonparametric covariance regression model by relating these location-specific trajectories to a lower-dimensional subspace through a latent factor model with predictor-dependent factor loadings. These loadings are in terms of a collection of basis functions that vary nonparametrically over the predictor space. Such low-rank approximations are in contrast to sparse precision assumptions, and are appropriate in a wide range of applications. Our formulation aims to address three challenges: scaling to large p domains, coping with missing values, and allowing an irregular grid of observations.

Traditional results dictate that for an algorithm to provably correctly recover the underlying clusters, all clusters must be sufficiently large-in particular, the cluster sizes need to be (Omega) over tilde(root n), where n is the number of nodes of the graph. We show that this is not really a restriction: by a refined analysis of a convex-optimization-based recovery approach, we prove that small clusters, under certain mild assumptions, do not hinder recovery of large ones. Based on this result, we further devise an iterative algorithm to provably recover almost all clusters via a peeling strategy: we recover large clusters first, leading to a reduced problem, and repeat this procedure. These results are extended to the partial observation setting, in which only a (chosen) part of the graph is observed. The peeling strategy gives rise to an active learning algorithm, in which edges adjacent to smaller clusters are queried more often after large clusters are learned (and removed).

When equipped with kernel functions, similarly to other SVM learning algorithms, SGD is susceptible to the curse of kernelization that causes unbounded linear growth in model size and update time with data size. This may render SGD inapplicable to large data sets. We address this issue by presenting a class of Budgeted SGD (BSGD) algorithms for large-scale kernel SVM training which have constant space and constant time complexity per update. Specifically, BSGD keeps the number of support vectors bounded during training through several budget maintenance strategies. We treat the budget maintenance as a source of the gradient error, and show that the gap between the BSGD and the optimal SVM solutions depends on the model degradation due to budget maintenance. To minimize the gap, we study greedy budget maintenance methods based on removal, projection, and merging of support vectors. We propose budgeted versions of several popular online SVM algorithms that belong to the SGD family. We further derive BSGD algorithms for multi-class SVM training. Comprehensive empirical results show that BSGD achieves higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art budgeted online algorithms and comparable to non-budget algorithms, while achieving impressive computational efficiency both in time and space during training and prediction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,OCT,2012,13,,,,,,3103,3131,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000313200000010,0

The latent and visible variables at each time step receive directed connections from the visible variables at the last few time-steps. This conditional RBM (CRBM) makes on-line inference efficient and allows us to use a simple approximate learning procedure. We demonstrate the power of our approach by synthesizing various sequences from a model trained on motion capture data and by performing on-line filling in of data lost during capture. We extend the CRBM in a way that preserves its most important computational properties and introduces multiplicative three-way interactions that allow the effective interaction weight between two variables to be modulated by the dynamic state of a third variable. We introduce a factoring of the implied three-way weight tensor to permit a more compact parameterization. The resulting model can capture diverse styles of motion with a single set of parameters, and the three-way interactions greatly improve its ability to blend motion styles or to transition smoothly among them.

Usually, no attempt is made to identify sensitive parameters, and those that are used are often given factory-supplied default values, or values obtained from some non-systematic exploratory analysis. The immediate consequence of this is, of course, that it is not clear if better models could have been obtained if some form of parameter selection and optimisation had been performed. Questions follow inevitably on the experiments themselves: specifically, are all algorithms being treated fairly, and is the exploratory phase sufficiently well-defined to allow the experiments to be replicated? In this paper, we investigate the use of parameter selection and optimisation techniques grouped under the study of experimental design. Screening and response surface methods determine, in turn, sensitive parameters and good values for these parameters. Screening is done here by constructing a stepwise regression model relating the utility of an ILP system's hypothesis to its input parameters, using systematic combinations of values of input parameters (technically speaking, we use a two-level fractional factorial design of the input parameters). The parameters used by the regression model are taken to be the sensitive parameters for the system for that application. We then seek an assignment of values to these sensitive parameters that maximise the utility of the ILP model. This is done using the technique of constructing a local response surface. The parameters are then changed following the path of steepest ascent until a locally optimal value is reached. This combined use of parameter selection and response surface-driven optimisation has a long history of application in industrial engineering, and its role in ILP is demonstrated using well-known benchmarks. The results suggest that computational overheads from this preliminary phase are not substantial, and that much can be gained, both on improving system performance and on enabling controlled experimentation, by adopting well-established procedures such as the ones proposed here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,FEB,2011,12,,,,,,627,662,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000288896800009,0

We distinguish among two tasks in matrix data analysis: discriminative prediction of the missing entries in data matrices and estimation of the joint probability distribution of row and column variables in co-occurrence matrices. We derive PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds for the expected out-of-sample performance of co-clustering-based solutions for these two tasks. The analysis yields regularization terms that were absent in the previous formulations of co-clustering. The bounds suggest that the expected performance of co-clustering is governed by a trade-off between its empirical performance and the mutual information preserved by the cluster variables on row and column IDs. We derive an iterative projection algorithm for finding a local optimum of this trade-off for discriminative prediction tasks. This algorithm achieved state-of-the-art performance in the MovieLens collaborative filtering task. Our co-clustering model can also be seen as matrix tri-factorization and the results provide generalization bounds, regularization terms, and new algorithms for this form of matrix factorization. The analysis of co-clustering is extended to tree-shaped graphical models, which can be used to analyze high dimensional tensors. According to the bounds, the generalization abilities of tree-shaped graphical models depend on a trade-off between their empirical data fit and the mutual information that is propagated up the tree levels. We also formulate weighted graph clustering as a prediction problem: given a subset of edge weights we analyze the ability of graph clustering to predict the remaining edge weights. The analysis of co-clustering easily extends to this problem and suggests that graph clustering should optimize the trade-off between empirical data fit and the mutual information that clusters preserve on graph nodes.",,,,,"Seldin, Yevgeny/G-8955-2015","Seldin, Yevgeny/0000-0003-3152-4635",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,DEC,2010,11,,,,,,3595,3646,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000286637200011,0

The standard ( inductive) approach is to declare novelties where the nominal density is low, which reduces the problem to density level set estimation. In this paper, we consider the setting where an unlabeled and possibly contaminated sample is also available at learning time. We argue that novelty detection in this semi-supervised setting is naturally solved by a general reduction to a binary classification problem. In particular, a detector with a desired false positive rate can be achieved through a reduction to Neyman-Pearson classification. Unlike the inductive approach, semi-supervised novelty detection (SSND) yields detectors that are optimal (e.g., statistically consistent) regardless of the distribution on novelties. Therefore, in novelty detection, unlabeled data have a substantial impact on the theoretical properties of the decision rule. We validate the practical utility of SSND with an extensive experimental study. We also show that SSND provides distribution-free, learning-theoretic solutions to two well known problems in hypothesis testing. First, our results provide a general solution to the general two-sample problem, that is, the problem of determining whether two random samples arise from the same distribution. Second, a specialization of SSND coincides with the standard p-value approach to multiple testing under the so-called random effects model.

In this vein, this paper suggests to use the framework of stochastic optimal control with path integrals to derive a novel approach to RL with parameterized policies. While solidly grounded in value function estimation and optimal control based on the stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations, policy improvements can be transformed into an approximation problem of a path integral which has no open algorithmic parameters other than the exploration noise. The resulting algorithm can be conceived of as model-based, semi-model-based, or even model free, depending on how the learning problem is structured. The update equations have no danger of numerical instabilities as neither matrix inversions nor gradient learning rates are required. Our new algorithm demonstrates interesting similarities with previous RL research in the framework of probability matching and provides intuition why the slightly heuristically motivated probability matching approach can actually perform well. Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant performance improvements over gradient-based policy learning and scalability to high-dimensional control problems. Finally, a learning experiment on a simulated 12 degree-of-freedom robot dog illustrates the functionality of our algorithm in a complex robot learning scenario.

The FAIR method improves the design of naive-Bayes classifiers in sparse setups. The improvement is due to reducing the noise in estimating the features' means. This reduction is since that only the means of a few selected variables should be estimated. We also consider the design of naive Bayes classifiers. We show that a good alternative to variable selection is estimation of the means through a certain non parametric empirical Bayes procedure.

By taking proper account of the contribution to the evidence from the large number of model parameters we show that model selection accuracy is substantially improved. The accuracy of the improved model evidence is studied in the asymptotic limit d -> infinity at fixed ratio alpha = N/d, with alpha < 1. In this limit, model selection based upon the improved model evidence agrees with a frequentist hypothesis testing approach.",,,,,,"Hoyle, David/0000-0003-3483-5885",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,DEC,2008,9,,,,,,2733,2759,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000263240700005,0

For this purpose, we suggest the prediction risk bounds of regression models using the modulus of continuity which can be interpreted as the complexity of functions. We also present the model selection criterion referred to as the modulus of continuity information criterion (MCIC) which is derived from the suggested prediction risk bounds. The suggested MCIC provides a risk estimate using the modulus of continuity for a trained regression model (or an estimation function) while other model selection criteria such as the AIC and BIC use structural information such as the number of training parameters. As a result, the suggested MCIC is able to discriminate the performances of trained regression models, even with the same structure of training models. To show the effectiveness of the proposed method, the simulation for function approximation using the multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) was conducted. Through the simulation for function approximation, it was demonstrated that the suggested MCIC provides a good selection tool for nonlinear regression models, even with the limited size of data.",,,,,"Koo, Imhoi/E-5759-2011","Koo, Imhoi/0000-0002-5816-0627",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,NOV,2008,9,,,,,,2607,2633,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000262637600008,0

Efficient learning of parameters in these models is therefore an important problem, and becomes a key factor when learning from very large data sets. This paper describes exponentiated gradient (EG) algorithms for training such models, where EG updates are applied to the convex dual of either the log-linear or max-margin objective function; the dual in both the log-linear and max-margin cases corresponds to minimizing a convex function with simplex constraints. We study both batch and online variants of the algorithm, and provide rates of convergence for both cases. In the max-margin case, O (1/epsilon) EG updates are required to reach a given accuracy e in the dual; in contrast, for log-linear models only O (log (1/epsilon)) updates are required. For both the max-margin and log-linear cases, our bounds suggest that the online EG algorithm requires a factor of n less computation to reach a desired accuracy than the batch EG algorithm, where n is the number of training examples. Our experiments confirm that the online algorithms are much faster than the batch algorithms in practice. We describe how the EG updates factor in a convenient way for structured prediction problems, allowing the algorithms to be efficiently applied to problems such as sequence learning or natural language parsing. We perform extensive evaluation of the algorithms, comparing them to L-BFGS and stochastic gradient descent for log-linear models, and to SVM-Struct for max-margin models.

Kernel methods can learn complex functions, but a kernel over unordered set inputs must somehow solve for correspondences-generally a computationally expensive task that becomes impractical for large set sizes. We present a new fast kernel function called the pyramid match that measures partial match similarity in time linear in the number of features. The pyramid match maps unordered feature sets to multi-resolution histograms and computes a weighted histogram intersection in order to find implicit correspondences based on the finest resolution histogram cell where a matched pair first appears. We show the pyramid match yields a Mercer kernel, and we prove bounds on its error relative to the optimal partial matching cost.

We demonstrate that when domain knowledge is available, even in the form of weak and somewhat inaccurate assumptions, significantly less data is required to build an accurate model of user preferences than when no domain knowledge is provided. This approach is based on the KBANN (Knowledge-Based Artificial Neural Network) algorithm pioneered by Shavlik and Towell (1989). We demonstrate this approach through two examples, one involves preferences under certainty, and the other involves preferences under uncertainty. In the case of certainty, we show how to encode assumptions concerning preferential independence and monotonicity in a KBANN network, which can be trained using a variety of preferential information including simple binary classification. In the case of uncertainty, we show how to construct a KBANN network that encodes certain types of dominance relations and attitude toward risk. The resulting network can be trained using answers to standard gamble questions and can be used as an approximate representation of a person's preferences. We empirically evaluate our claims by comparing the KBANN networks with simple backpropagation artificial neural networks in terms of learning rate and accuracy. For the case of uncertainty, the answers to standard gamble questions used in the experiment are taken from an actual medical data set first used by Miyamoto and Eraker (1988). In the case of certainty, we define a measure to which a set of preferences violate a domain theory, and examine the robustness of the KBANN network as this measure of domain theory violation varies.",,,,,,"Haddawy, Peter/0000-0003-2203-006X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,Apr-01,2004,4,3,,,,,317,337,,10.1162/153244304773633843,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000221043900004,0

These are then removed from consideration, and the procedure is iterated until all points are classified. Geometrically, we can imagine that at each stage, points of the same classification are successively chopped off from the data set by a hyperplane. We analyse theoretically the generalization properties of data classification techniques that are based on the use of threshold decision lists and on the special subclass of multilevel threshold functions. We present bounds on the generalization error in a standard probabilistic learning framework.

These are feed-forward neural networks in which each edge is given a random {0, 1}-valued filter, that have two modes of operation: in the first each edge output is multiplied by its random filter, resulting in a random output, while in the second each edge output is multiplied by the expectation of its filter, leading to a deterministic output. It is common to use the random mode during training and the deterministic mode during testing and prediction. Both theorems are of the following form: Given a function to approximate and a threshold epsilon > 0, there exists a dropout network that is epsilon-close in probability and in L-q. The first theorem applies to dropout networks in the random mode. It assumes little on the activation function, applies to a wide class of networks, and can even be applied to approximation schemes other than neural networks. The core is an algebraic property that shows that deterministic networks can be exactly matched in expectation by random networks. The second theorem makes stronger assumptions and gives a stronger result. Given a function to approximate, it provides existence of a network that approximates in both modes simultaneously. Proof components are a recursive replacement of edges by independent copies, and a special first-layer replacement that couples the resulting larger network to the input. The functions to be approximated are assumed to be elements of general normed spaces, and the approximations are measured in the corresponding norms. The networks are constructed explicitly. Because of the different methods of proof, the two results give independent insight into the approximation properties of random dropout networks.

This is a challenging issue because user preferences usually have complicated structure, such as inter-user preference similarity and intra-user preference diversity. Among them, inter-user similarity indicates different users may share similar preference, while intra-user diversity indicates one user may have several preferences. In literatures, deep generative models have been successfully applied in recommendation systems due to its flexibility on statistical dis-tributions and strong ability for non-linear representation learning. However, they suffer from the simple generative process when handling complex user preferences. Meanwhile, the latent representations learned by deep generative models are usually entangled, and may range from observed-level ones that dominate the complex correlations between users, to latent-level ones that characterize a user's preference, which makes the deep model hard to explain and unfriendly for recommendation. Thus, in this paper, we propose an Interpretable Deep Generative Recommendation Model (InDGRM) to characterize inter-user preference similarity and intra-user preference diversity, which will simultane-ously disentangle the learned representation from observed-level and latent-level. In InD-GRM, the observed-level disentanglement on users is achieved by modeling the user-cluster structure (i.e., inter-user preference similarity) in a rich multimodal space, so that users with similar preferences are assigned into the same cluster. The observed-level disentangle-ment on items is achieved by modeling the intra-user preference diversity in a prototype learning strategy, where different user intentions are captured by item groups (one group refers to one intention). To promote disentangled latent representations, InDGRM adopts structure and sparsity-inducing penalty and integrates them into the generative procedure, which has ability to enforce each latent factor focus on a limited subset of items (e.g., one item group) and benefit latent-level disentanglement. Meanwhile, it can be efficiently inferred by minimizing its penalized upper bound with the aid of local variational optimiza-tion technique. Theoretically, we analyze the generalization error bound of InDGRM to guarantee its performance. A series of experimental results on four widely-used benchmark datasets demonstrates the superiority of InDGRM on recommendation performance and interpretability.(1)",,,,,"Ng, Michael/B-7189-2009","Ng, Michael/0000-0001-6833-5227",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2021,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000706888200001,0

Through both experimental and theoretical approaches, we identify three regimes in the phase diagram, i.e., linear regime, critical regime and condensed regime, based on the relative change of input weights as the width approaches infinity, which tends to 0, O (1) and +infinity, respectively. In the linear regime, NN training dynamics is approximately linear similar to a random feature model with an exponential loss decay. In the condensed regime, we demonstrate through experiments that active neurons are condensed at several discrete orientations. The critical regime serves as the boundary between above two regimes, which exhibits an intermediate nonlinear behavior with the mean-field model as a typical example. Overall, our phase diagram for the two-layer ReLU NN serves as a map for the future studies and is a first step towards a more systematical investigation of the training behavior and the implicit regularization of NNs of different structures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2021,22,,,,,,1,47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000656374200001,0

The idea is to steer the exploration process towards the interests of the user, instead of showing uninteresting or already known relations. The user's knowledge is modelled by a distribution over data sets parametrised by subsets of rows and columns of data, called tile constraints. We provide a computationally efficient implementation of this concept based on constrained randomisation. Furthermore, we describe a novel dimensionality reduction method for finding the views most informative to the user, which at the limit of no background knowledge and with generic objectives reduces to PCA.

In a basic and traditional formulation a separate model is fit for each value of the categorical feature, using only the data that has the specific categorical value. To this formulation we add Laplacian regularization, which encourages the model parameters for neighboring categorical values to be similar. Laplacian regularization allows us to specify one or more weighted graphs on the stratification feature values. For example, stratifying over the days of the week, we can specify that the Sunday model parameter should be close to the Saturday and Monday model parameters. The regularization improves the performance of the model over the traditional stratified model, since the model for each value of the categorical 'borrows strength' from its neighbors. In particular, it produces a model even for categorical values that did not appear in the training data set. We propose an efficient distributed method for fitting stratified models, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). When the fitting loss functions are convex, the stratified model fitting problem is convex, and our method computes the global minimizer of the loss plus regularization; in other cases it computes a local minimizer. The method is very efficient, and naturally scales to large data sets or numbers of stratified feature values.

In this work, our main goal is to understand what aspects of DR methods are important for preserving both local and global structure: it is difficult to design a better method without a true understanding of the choices we make in our algorithms and their empirical impact on the low-dimensional embeddings they produce. Towards the goal of local structure preservation, we provide several useful design principles for DR loss functions based on our new understanding of the mechanisms behind successful DR methods. Towards the goal of global structure preservation, our analysis illuminates that the choice of which components to preserve is important.

In response to these challenges, this paper studies large-scale panel data with an interactive effects model. This model takes into account the individual impacts of covariates on each spatial node and removes the exogenous condition by allowing latent factors to affect both covariates and errors. Besides, we waive the sub-Gaussian assumption and allow the errors to be heavy-tailed. Further, we propose a data-driven procedure to learn a parsimonious yet flexible homogeneity structure embedded in high-dimensional individual impacts of covariates. The homogeneity structure assumes that there exists a partition of regression coefficients where the coefficients are the same within each group but different between the groups. The homogeneity structure is flexible as it contains many widely assumed low-dimensional structures (sparsity, global impact, etc.) as its special cases.

However, deploying such models in the real-world requires extra care: we must ensure their reliability, robustness, and absence of undesired biases. This motivates the development of models that are equally accurate but can be also easily inspected and assessed beyond their predictive performance. To this end, we introduce contextual explanation networks (CENs)-a class of architectures that learn to predict by generating and utilizing intermediate, simplified probabilistic models. Specifically, CENs generate parameters for intermediate graphical models which are further used for prediction and play the role of explanations. Contrary to the existing post-hoc model-explanation tools, CENs learn to predict and to explain simultaneously. Our approach offers two major advantages: (i) for each prediction, valid, instance-specific explanation is generated with no computational overhead and (ii) prediction via explanation acts as a regularizer and boosts performance in data-scarce settings. We analyze the proposed framework theoretically and experimentally. Our results on image and text classification and survival analysis tasks demonstrate that CENs are not only competitive with the state-of-the-art methods but also offer additional insights behind each prediction, that can be valuable for decision support.

Most of the known techniques for solving the RPCA rely on convex relaxation methods by lifting the problem to a higher dimension, which significantly increase the number of variables. As an alternative, the well-known Burer-Monteiro approach can be used to cast the RPCA as a non-convex and non-smooth '1 optimization problem with a significantly smaller number of variables.

An implication of this result is that simple local search algorithms are guaranteed to achieve a zero global optimality gap when directly applied to the low-dimensional formulation.

In addition, as TPTT uses target propagation, it allows for discrete nonlinearities and could potentially mitigate the credit assignment problem in more complex recurrent architectures.",,,,,"Spratling, Michael/G-7689-2011","Spratling, Michael/0000-0001-9531-2813",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2020,21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000513691300007,0

Despite many advances over the past three decades, learning in many domains still requires a large amount of interaction with the environment, which can be prohibitively expensive in realistic scenarios. To address this problem, transfer learning has been applied to reinforcement learning such that experience gained in one task can be leveraged when starting to learn the next, harder task. More recently, several lines of research have explored how tasks, or data samples themselves, can be sequenced into a curriculum for the purpose of learning a problem that may otherwise be too difficult to learn from scratch.

Therefore, it is desirable to perform inference in a data-driven, nonparametric approach. Many recent works have proposed nonparametric Hawkes process models based on Gaussian processes (GP). However, the likelihood is non-conjugate to the prior resulting in a complicated and time-consuming inference procedure. To address the problem, we present the sigmoid Gaussian Hawkes process model in this paper: the baseline intensity and triggering kernel are both modeled as the sigmoid transformation of random trajectories drawn from a GP. By introducing auxiliary latent random variables (branching structure, Polya-Gamma random variables and latent marked Poisson processes), the likelihood is converted to two decoupled components with a Gaussian form which allows for an efficient conjugate analytical inference. Using the augmented likelihood, we derive an efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm to sample from the posterior; an efficient expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to obtain the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate and furthermore an efficient mean-field variational inference algorithm to approximate the posterior. To further accelerate the inference, a sparse GP approximation is introduced to reduce complexity. We demonstrate the performance of our three algorithms on both simulated and real data.

To show this, we introduce a new SVM formulation, called the EC-SVM, which is derived from a simple bPOE minimization problem that is easy to interpret with a meaningful free parameter, optimal objective value, and probabilistic derivation. Over the range of its free parameter, the EC-SVM has both a convex and non-convex case which we connect to existing SVM formulations. We first show that the C-SVM, formulated with any regularization norm, is equivalent to the convex EC-SVM. Similarly, we show that the E nu-SVM is equivalent to the EC-SVM over its entire parameter range, which includes both the convex and non-convex case. These equivalences, coupled with the interpretability of the EC-SVM, allow us to gain surprising new insights into the C-SVM and fully connect soft margin support vector classification with superquantile and bPOE concepts. We also show that the EC-SVM can easily be cast as a robust optimization problem, where bPOE is minimized with data lying in a fixed uncertainty set. This reformulation allows us to clearly differentiate between the convex and non-convex case, with convexity associated with pessimistic views of uncertainty and non-convexity associated with optimistic views of uncertainty. Finally, we address some practical considerations. First, we show that these new insights can assist in making parameter selection more efficient. Second, we discuss optimization approaches for solving the EC-SVM.

Fisher consistency is a desirable property for surrogate loss functions and implies that in the population setting, i.e., if the probability distribution that generates the data were available, then optimization of the surrogate would yield the best possible model. In this paper we will characterize the Fisher consistency of a rich family of surrogate loss functions used in the context of ordinal regression, including support vector ordinal regression, ORBoosting and least absolute deviation. We will see that, for a family of surrogate loss functions that subsumes support vector ordinal regression and ORBoosting, consistency can be fully characterized by the derivative of a real-valued function at zero, as happens for convex margin-based surrogates in binary classification. We also derive excess risk bounds for a surrogate of the absolute error that generalize existing risk bounds for binary classification.

A lower bound on the Bayes risk not only serves as a lower bound on the minimax risk, but also characterizes the fundamental limit of any estimator given the prior knowledge. Our bounds are based on the notion of f-informativity (Csiszar, 1972), which is a function of the underlying class of probability measures and the prior. Application of our bounds requires upper bounds on the f-informativity, thus we derive new upper bounds on f-informativity which often lead to tight Bayes risk lower bounds. Our technique leads to generalizations of a variety of classical minimax bounds (e.g., generalized Fano's inequality). Our Bayes risk lower bounds can be directly applied to several concrete estimation problems, including Gaussian location models, generalized linear models, and principal component analysis for spiked covariance models. To further demonstrate the applications of our Bayes risk lower bounds to machine learning problems, we present two new theoretical results: (1) a precise characterization of the minimax risk of learning spherical Gaussian mixture models under the smoothed analysis framework, and (2) lower bounds for the Bayes risk under a natural prior for both the prediction and estimation errors for high-dimensional sparse linear regression under an improper learning setting.",,,,,"Zhang, Yuchen/GYI-8858-2022; Zhang, ShiLiang/AAA-4638-2020",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2016,17,,,,,,1,58,218,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000391838200001,0

Because of the advent of many crowdsourcing services, a crowd of workers are often hired to conduct pairwise comparisons with a small monetary reward for each pair they compare. Since different workers have different levels of reliability and different pairs have different levels of ambiguity, it is desirable to wisely allocate the limited budget for comparisons among the pairs of items and workers so that the global ranking can be accurately inferred from the comparison results. To this end, we model the active sampling problem in crowdsourced ranking as a Bayesian Markov decision process, which dynamically selects item pairs and workers to improve the ranking accuracy under a budget constraint.

The approach implements this idea in the context of neural network architectures that are trained on labeled data from the source domain and unlabeled data from the target domain (no labeled target-domain data is necessary). As the training progresses, the approach promotes the emergence of features that are (i) discriminative for the main learning task on the source domain and (ii) indiscriminate with respect to the shift between the domains.

It is much cheaper and easier to collect large quantities of image-level labels from search engines than it is to collect scene-centric images with precisely localized labels. We develop methods for learning large scale recognition models which exploit joint training over both weak (image-level) and strong (bounding box) labels and which transfer learned perceptual representations from strongly-labeled auxiliary tasks.

Our approach instantiated to linear settings has close relations to the partitioned matrix inversion mechanism based on Schur's complement. For arbitrary regression methods, even a relaxation of the approach is no worse than using the model from the previous step or using a model that learns on the additional features and optimizes the residual of the model at the previous step. Such problems are commonplace in complex manufacturing operations consisting of hundreds of steps, where multiple measurements are taken at each step to monitor the quality of the final product.

Many of these can be formalized as regularized function estimation through the minimization of a quadratic cost. However, most existing label diffusion methods minimize a univariate cost with the classification function as the only variable of interest. Since the observed labels seed the diffusion process, such univariate frameworks are extremely sensitive to the initial label choice and any label noise. To alleviate the dependency on the initial observed labels, this article proposes a bivariate formulation for graph-based SSL, where both the binary label information and a continuous classification function are arguments of the optimization. This bivariate formulation is shown to be equivalent to a linearly constrained Max-Cut problem. Finally an efficient solution via greedy gradient Max-Cut (GGMC) is derived which gradually assigns unlabeled vertices to each class with minimum connectivity. Once convergence guarantees are established, this greedy Max-Cut based SSL is applied on both artificial and standard benchmark data sets where it obtains superior classification accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art SSL methods. Moreover, GGMC shows robustness with respect to the graph construction method and maintains high accuracy over extensive experiments with various edge linking and weighting schemes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,MAR,2013,14,,,,,,771,800,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000317461700002,0

When the objective consists of a loss function plus a nonsmooth regularization term, the solution often lies on a low-dimensional manifold of parameter space along which the regularizer is smooth. (When an l(1) regularizer is used to induce sparsity in the solution, for example, this manifold is defined by the set of nonzero components of the parameter vector.) This paper shows that a regularized dual averaging algorithm can identify this manifold, with high probability, before reaching the solution. This observation motivates an algorithmic strategy in which, once an iterate is suspected of lying on an optimal or near-optimal manifold, we switch to a local phase that searches in this manifold, thus converging rapidly to a near-optimal point.

We propose two consistent and computationally efficient algorithms for learning minimal latent trees, that is, trees without any redundant hidden nodes. Unlike many existing methods, the observed nodes (or variables) are not constrained to be leaf nodes. Our algorithms can be applied to both discrete and Gaussian random variables and our learned models are such that all the observed and latent variables have the same domain (state space). Our first algorithm, recursive grouping, builds the latent tree recursively by identifying sibling groups using so-called information distances. One of the main contributions of this work is our second algorithm, which we refer to as CLGrouping. CLGrouping starts with a pre-processing procedure in which a tree over the observed variables is constructed. This global step groups the observed nodes that are likely to be close to each other in the true latent tree, thereby guiding subsequent recursive grouping (or equivalent procedures such as neighbor-joining) on much smaller subsets of variables. This results in more accurate and efficient learning of latent trees. We also present regularized versions of our algorithms that learn latent tree approximations of arbitrary distributions. We compare the proposed algorithms to other methods by performing extensive numerical experiments on various latent tree graphical models such as hidden Markov models and star graphs. In addition, we demonstrate the applicability of our methods on real-world data sets by modeling the dependency structure of monthly stock returns in the S&P index and of the words in the 20 newsgroups data set.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,MAY,2011,12,,,,,,1771,1812,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000292304000010,0

The number of training examples a learner needs for identifying a concept in a given class C of possible target concepts (sample complexity of C) is lower in models assuming such teachers, that is, helpful examples can speed up the learning process. The problem of how a teacher and a learner can cooperate in order to reduce the sample complexity, yet without using coding tricks, has been widely addressed. Nevertheless, the resulting teaching and learning protocols do not seem to make the teacher select intuitively helpful examples. The two models introduced in this paper are built on what we call subset teaching sets and recursive teaching sets. They extend previous models of teaching by letting both the teacher and the learner exploit knowing that the partner is cooperative. For this purpose, we introduce a new notion of coding trick/collusion. We show how both resulting sample complexity measures (the subset teaching dimension and the recursive teaching dimension) can be arbitrarily lower than the classic teaching dimension and known variants thereof, without using coding tricks. For instance, monomials can be taught with only two examples independent of the number of variables. The subset teaching dimension turns out to be nonmonotonic with respect to subclasses of concept classes. We discuss why this nonmonotonicity might be inherent in many interesting cooperative teaching and learning scenarios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,FEB,2011,12,,,,,,349,384,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000288896800001,0

The approximation is applicable to a wide range of generative models and provides an interpretation of the benefits of preselection in terms of a variational EM approximation. To empirically show that the method maximizes the data likelihood, it is applied to different types of generative models including: a version of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), a model for non-linear component extraction (MCA), and a linear generative model similar to sparse coding.

Working under the restriction of limited computation, we analyze a joint method in which the same convex variational relaxation is used to construct an M-estimator for fitting parameters, and to perform approximate marginalization for the prediction step. The key result of this paper is that in the computation-limited setting, using an inconsistent parameter estimator (i.e., an estimator that returns the wrong model even in the infinite data limit) is provably beneficial, since the resulting errors can partially compensate for errors made by using an approximate prediction technique.

This stability result provides additional incentive, apart from the obvious benefit of unique global optima, for using message-passing methods based on convex variational relaxations.

A very recent developement, the relaxation of combinatorial problems to semi-definite programs ( SDP), has gained considerable attention over the last decade (Helmberg, 2000; De Bie and Cristianini, 2004a). Although SDP problems can be solved in polynomial time, for many relaxations the exponent in the polynomial complexity bounds is too high for scaling to large problem sizes. This has hampered their uptake as a powerful new tool in machine learning. In this paper, we present a new and fast SDP relaxation of the normalized graph cut problem, and investigate its usefulness in unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. In particular, this provides a convex algorithm for transduction, as well as approaches to clustering. We further propose a whole cascade of fast relaxations that all hold the middle between older spectral relaxations and the new SDP relaxation, allowing one to trade off computational cost versus relaxation accuracy. Finally, we discuss how the methodology developed in this paper can be applied to other combinatorial problems in machine learning, and we treat the max-cut problem as an example.",,,,,"De Bie, Tijl/B-2920-2013","De Bie, Tijl/0000-0002-2692-7504",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,JUL,2006,7,,,,,,1409,1436,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000245388800011,0

This is usually done with an iterative decomposition algorithm operating on a small working set of variables in every iteration. The training time strongly depends on the selection of these variables. We propose the maximum-gain working set selection algorithm for large scale quadratic programming. It is based on the idea to greedily maximize the progress in each single iteration. The algorithm takes second order information from cached kernel matrix entries into account. We prove the convergence to an optimal solution of a variant termed hybrid maximum-gain working set selection. This method is empirically compared to the prominent most violating pair selection and the latest algorithm using second order information. For large training sets our new selection scheme is significantly faster.,,,,,"Igel, Christian/B-4091-2009","Igel, Christian/0000-0003-2868-0856",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,JUL,2006,7,,,,,,1437,1466,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000245388800012,0

This paper studies the very commonly used K-fold cross-validation estimator of generalization performance. The main theorem shows that there exists no universal ( valid under all distributions) unbiased estimator of the variance of K-fold cross-validation. The analysis that accompanies this result is based on the eigen-decomposition of the covariance matrix of errors, which has only three different eigenvalues corresponding to three degrees of freedom of the matrix and three components of the total variance. This analysis helps to better understand the nature of the problem and how it can make naive estimators ( that don't take into account the error correlations due to the overlap between training and test sets) grossly underestimate variance.

It is commonly believed that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are architecturally invariant to translation thanks to the convolution and/or pooling operations they are endowed with. In fact, several studies have found that these networks systematically fail to recognise new objects on untrained locations. In this work, we test a wide variety of CNNs architectures showing how, apart from DenseNet-121, none of the models tested was architecturally invariant to translation. Nevertheless, all of them could learn to be invariant to translation. We show how this can be achieved by pretraining on ImageNet, and it is sometimes possible with much simpler data sets when all the items are fully translated across the input canvas. At the same time, this invariance can be disrupted by further training due to catastrophic forgetting/interference.

For example, distribution functions are nondecreasing and range between zero and one, height growth charts are nondecreasing in age, and production functions are nondecreasing and quasi-concave in input quantities. We propose a method to enforce these restrictions ex post on generic unconstrained point and interval estimates of the target function by applying functional operators. The interval estimates could be either frequentist confidence bands or Bayesian credible regions. If an operator has reshaping, invariance, order-preserving, and distance reducing properties, the shape-enforced point estimates are closer to the target function than the original point estimates and the shape-enforced interval estimates have greater coverage and shorter length than the original interval estimates. We show that these properties hold for six different operators that cover commonly used shape restrictions in practice: range, convexity, monotonicity, monotone convexity, quasi-convexity, and monotone quasi-convexity, with the latter two restrictions being of paramount importance. The main attractive property of the post-processing approach is that it works in conjunction with any generic initial point or interval estimate, obtained using any of parametric, semi parametric or nonparametric learning methods, including recent methods that are able to exploit either smoothness, sparsity, or other forms of structured parsimony of target functions. The post-processed point and interval estimates automatically inherit and provably improve these properties in finite samples, while also enforcing qualitative shape restrictions brought by scientific reasoning.

We give two main algorithmic results for learning such distributions. First, for the case vertical bar A vertical bar = 3, we give an algorithm for learning an unknown A-sum to accuracy  using poly(1/epsilon) samples and running in time poly(1/epsilon), independent of N and of the elements of A. Second, for an arbitrary constant k >= 4, if A = {a(1), ..., ak(g)} with 0 <= a(1) < ... < a(k), we give an algorithm that uses poly(1=) log log ak samples (independent of N) and runs in time poly(1/epsilon; loga(k)): We prove an essentially matching lower bound: if vertical bar A vertical bar = 4, then any algorithm must use Omega(log log a(4)) samples even for learning to constant accuracy. We also give similar-in-spirit (but quantitatively very different) algorithmic results, and essentially matching lower bounds, for the case in which A is not known to the learner. Our algorithms and lower bounds together settle the question of how the sample complexity of learning sums of independent integer random variables scales with the elements in the union of their supports, both in the known-support and unknown-support settings.

Typically, the essential ingredient of these methods is some form of randomized dimension reduction, which accelerates computations, but also creates random approximation error. In this way, the dimension reduction step encodes a tradeoff between cost and accuracy. However, the exact numerical relationship between cost and accuracy is typically unknown, and consequently, it may be difficult for the user to precisely know (1) how accurate a given solution is, or (2) how much computation is needed to achieve a given level of accuracy. In the current paper, we study randomized matrix multiplication (sketching) as a prototype setting for addressing these general problems. As a solution, we develop a bootstrap method for directly estimating the accuracy as a function of the reduced dimension (as opposed to deriving worst-case bounds on the accuracy in terms of the reduced dimension).

For non-smooth objective functions, while the dominant term of the error is in O(1/root t), the structure of the communication network only impacts a second-order term in O(1/t), where t is time. In other words, the error due to limits in communication resources decreases at a fast rate even in the case of non-strongly convex objective functions.

We establish a tight bound to quantitatively characterize the deviation of the thresholded solution from a given signal. Our theoretical result is universal in the sense that it holds for all choices of parameters, and the underlying analysis depends only on fundamental arguments in mathematical optimization. We discuss the implications for two domains: Compressed Sensing. On account of the crucial estimate, we bridge the connection between the restricted isometry property (RIP) and the sparsity parameter for a vast volume of hard thresholding based algorithms, which renders an improvement on the RIP condition especially when the true sparsity is unknown. This suggests that in essence, many more kinds of sensing matrices or fewer measurements are admissible for the data acquisition procedure. Machine Learning. In terms of large-scale machine learning, a significant yet challenging problem is learning accurate sparse models in an efficient manner. In stark contrast to prior work that attempted the l(1)-relaxation for promoting sparsity, we present a novel stochastic algorithm which performs hard thresholding in each iteration, hence ensuring such parsimonious solutions.

SGD methods are easy to implement and applicable to a wide range of convex optimization problems. In contrast, RLA algorithms provide much stronger performance guarantees but are applicable to a narrower class of problems. We aim to bridge the gap between these two methods in solving constrained overdetermined linear regression problems-e.g., l(2) and l(1) regression problems. .We propose a hybrid algorithm named PWSGD that uses RLA techniques for preconditioning and constructing an importance sampling distribution, and then performs an SGD- like iterative process with weighted sampling on the preconditioned system. . By rewriting a deterministic l(p) regression problem as a stochastic optimization problem, we connect PWSGD to several existing l(p) solvers including RLA methods with algorithmic leveraging (RLA for short). .We prove that PWSGD inherits faster convergence rates that only depend on the lower dimension of the linear system, while maintaining low computation complexity. Such SGD convergence rates are superior to other related SGD algorithm such as the weighted randomized Kaczmarz algorithm. . Particularly, when solving l(1) regression with size n by d, PWSGD returns an approximate solution with epsilon relative error in the objective value in O (log n . nnz(A) + poly(d)/epsilon(2)) time. This complexity is uniformly better than that of RLA methods in terms of both epsilon and d when the problem is unconstrained. In the presence of constraints, PWSGD only has to solve a sequence of much simpler and smaller optimization problem over the same constraints. In general this is more efficient than solving the constrained subproblem required in RLA. .For l(2) regression, PWSGD returns an approximate solution with epsilon relative error in the objective value and the solution vector measured in prediction norm in O (log n . nnz(A)+ poly(d) log(1/epsilon) / epsilon) time. We show that for unconstrained l(2) regression, this complexity is comparable to that of RLA and is asymptotically better over several state-of-the-art solvers in the regime where the desired accuracy epsilon, high dimension n and low dimension d satisfy d >= 1/epsilon and n >= d(2)/epsilon. We also provide lower bounds on the coreset complexity for more general regression problems, indicating that still new ideas will be needed to extend similar RLA preconditioning ideas to weighted SGD algorithms for more general regression problems. Finally, the effectiveness of such algorithms is illustrated numerically on both synthetic and real datasets, and the results are consistent with our theoretical findings and demonstrate that PWSGD converges to a medium-precision solution, e. g., epsilon = 10 3, more quickly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2018,18,,,,,,,,211,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000435628500001,0

The aim of this technical note is to discuss the inconsistencies of the mean-ranks post-hoc test with the goal of discouraging its use in machine learning as well as in medicine, psychology, etc.. We show that the outcome of the mean-ranks test depends on the pool of algorithms originally included in the experiment. In other words, the outcome of the comparison between algorithms A and B depends also on the performance of the other algorithms included in the original experiment. This can lead to paradoxical situations. For instance the difference between A and B could be declared significant if the pool comprises algorithms C,D,E and not significant if the pool comprises algorithms F,G,H.

A simulator-based model is a parametrized mechanism which specifies how data are generated. It is thus also referred to as generative model. We assume that only a finite number of parameters are of interest and allow the generative process to be very general; it may be a noisy nonlinear dynamical system with an unrestricted number of hidden variables. This weak assumption is useful for devising realistic models but it renders statistical inference very difficult. The main challenge is the intractability of the likelihood function. Several likelihood-free inference methods have been proposed which share the basic idea of identifying the parameters by finding values for which the discrepancy between simulated and observed data is small. A major obstacle to using these methods is their computational cost. The cost is largely due to the need to repeatedly simulate data sets and the lack of knowledge about how the parameters affect the discrepancy. We propose a strategy which combines probabilistic modeling of the discrepancy with optimization to facilitate likelihood-free inference. The strategy is implemented using Bayesian optimization and is shown to accelerate the inference through a reduction in the number of required simulations by several orders of magnitude.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2016,17,,,,,,,,125,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000391655000001,0

Both conditions have been extensively used for causal inference by refuting factorizations for which the condition does not hold. Violation of faithfulness happens when there are CIs that do not follow from the Markov condition. For those CIs, non-trivial constraints among some parameters of the Conditional Probability Distributions (CPDs) must hold. When such a constraint is defined over parameters of different CPDs, we prove that IC is also violated unless the parameters have a simple description. To understand which non-Markovian CIs are permitted we define a new condition closely related to IC: the Independence from Product Constraints (IPC). The condition reflects that CIs might be the result of specific parameterizations of individual CPDs but not from constraints on parameters of different CPDs. In that sense it is more restrictive than IC: parameters may have a simple description. On the other hand, IC also excludes other forms of algorithmic dependencies between CPDs. Finally, we prove that on top of the CIs permitted by the Markov condition (faithfulness), IPC allows non-minimality, deterministic relations and what we called proportional CPDs. These are the only cases in which a CI follows from a specific parameterization of a single CPD.",,,,,"Lemeire, Jan/AAJ-6474-2020","Lemeire, Jan/0000-0002-2106-448X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2016,17,,,,,,1,20,151,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000391663100001,0

BO is attractive for this problem because it exploits Bayesian prior information about the expected return and exploits this knowledge to select new policies to execute. Effectively, the BO framework for policy search addresses the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. In this work, we show how to more effectively apply BO to RL by exploiting the sequential trajectory information generated by RL agents. Our contributions can be broken into two distinct, but mutually beneficial, parts. The first is a new Gaussian process (GP) kernel for measuring the similarity between policies using trajectory data generated from policy executions. This kernel can be used in order to improve posterior estimates of the expected return thereby improving the quality of exploration. The second contribution, is a new GP mean function which uses learned transition and reward functions to approximate the surface of the objective. We show that the model-based approach we develop can recover from model inaccuracies when good transition and reward models cannot be learned. We give empirical results in a standard set of RL benchmarks showing that both our model-based and model-free approaches can speed up learning compared to competing methods.

We propose an extension of slow feature analysis (SFA) for supervised dimensionality reduction called graph-based SFA (GSFA). The algorithm extracts a label-predictive low-dimensional set of features that can be post-processed by typical supervised algorithms to generate the final label or class estimation. GSFA is trained with a so-called training graph, in which the vertices are the samples and the edges represent similarities of the corresponding labels. A new weighted SFA optimization problem is introduced, generalizing the notion of slowness from sequences of samples to such training graphs. We show that GSFA computes an optimal solution to this problem in the considered function space and propose several types of training graphs. For classification, the most straightforward graph yields features equivalent to those of (nonlinear) Fisher discriminant analysis. Emphasis is on regression, where four different graphs were evaluated experimentally with a subproblem of face detection on photographs.

Compared with other features, the new feature set is invariant to scale and rotation, and has more compact and richer visual representations. For learning a discriminative model, all features extracted from training samples are clustered with the k-means algorithm to learn a visual codebook.

We address this problem in the context of model-based reinforcement learning in large stochastic relational domains by developing relational extensions of the concepts of the E-3 and R-MAX algorithms. Efficient exploration in exponentially large state spaces needs to exploit the generalization of the learned model: what in a propositional setting would be considered a novel situation and worth exploration may in the relational setting be a well-known context in which exploitation is promising. To address this we introduce relational count functions which generalize the classical notion of state and action visitation counts. We provide guarantees on the exploration efficiency of our framework using count functions under the assumption that we had a relational KWIK learner and a near-optimal planner. We propose a concrete exploration algorithm which integrates a practically efficient probabilistic rule learner and a relational planner (for which there are no guarantees, however) and employs the contexts of learned relational rules as features to model the novelty of states and actions.

For instance, classifiers are often trained and tested on trial-wise measurements, separately for each subject within a group. One important question is how classification outcomes observed in individual subjects can be generalized to the population from which the group was sampled. To address this question, this paper introduces novel statistical models that are guided by three desiderata. First, all models explicitly respect the hierarchical nature of the data, that is, they are mixed-effects models that simultaneously account for within-subjects (fixed-effects) and across-subjects (random-effects) variance components. Second, maximum-likelihood estimation is replaced by full Bayesian inference in order to enable natural regularization of the estimation problem and to afford conclusions in terms of posterior probability statements. Third, inference on classification accuracy is complemented by inference on the balanced accuracy, which avoids inflated accuracy estimates for imbalanced data sets. We introduce hierarchical models that satisfy these criteria and demonstrate their advantages over conventional methods using MCMC implementations for model inversion and model selection on both synthetic and empirical data.

The artificial prediction market is a novel method for fusing the prediction information of features or trained classifiers, where the fusion result is the contract price on the possible outcomes. The market can be trained online by updating the participants' budgets using training examples. Inspired by the real prediction markets, the equations that govern the market are derived from simple and reasonable assumptions. Efficient numerical algorithms are presented for solving these equations. The obtained artificial prediction market is shown to be a maximum likelihood estimator.

Furthermore, the market mechanism allows the aggregation of specialized classifiers that participate only on specific instances. Experimental comparisons show that the artificial prediction markets often outperform random forest and implicit online learning on synthetic data and real UCI data sets.

From a Gaussian processes perspective, the problem reduces to specifying an appropriate covariance function that, whilst being positive semi-definite, captures the dependencies between all the data points and across all the outputs. One approach to account for non-trivial correlations between outputs employs convolution processes. Under a latent function interpretation of the convolution transform we establish dependencies between output variables. The main drawbacks of this approach are the associated computational and storage demands. In this paper we address these issues. We present different efficient approximations for dependent output Gaussian processes constructed through the convolution formalism.

We then explore the problem of protocol identification in individual encrypted TCP connections, using much less data than in other recent approaches. The results of our evaluation show that our classifiers achieve accuracy greater than 90% for several protocols in aggregate traffic, and, for most protocols, greater than 80% when making fine-grained classifications on single connections. Moreover, perhaps most surprisingly, we show that one can even estimate the number of live connections in certain classes of encrypted tunnels to within, on average, better than 20%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,DEC,2006,7,,,,,,2745,2769,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000245390800010,0

Researchers use very detailed simulators to estimate processor performance, which models every cycle of an executing program. Unfortunately, simulating every cycle of a real program can take weeks or months. To address this problem we have created a tool called SimPoint that uses data clustering algorithms from machine learning to automatically find repetitive patterns in a program's execution. By simulating one representative of each repetitive behavior pattern, simulation time can be reduced to minutes instead of weeks for standard benchmark programs, with very little cost in terms of accuracy.

It is the main tool for learning decision trees and DNF expressions in the PAC model with respect to the uniform distribution. The algorithm requires access to the membership query (MQ) oracle. The access is often unavailable in learning applications and thus the KM algorithm cannot be used. We significantly weaken this requirement by producing an analogue of the KM algorithm that uses extended statistical queries (SQ) (SQs in which the expectation is taken with respect to a distribution given by a learning algorithm). We restrict a set of distributions that a learning algorithm may use for its statistical queries to be a set of product distributions with each bit being 1 with probability rho, 1/2 or 1 - rho for a constant 1/2 > rho > 0 (we denote the resulting model by SQ-D-rho). Our analogue finds all the large Fourier coefficients of degree lower than clog n (we call it the Bounded Sieve (BS)). We use BS to learn decision trees and by adapting Freund's boosting technique we give an algorithm that learns DNF in SQ-D-rho. An important property of the model is that its algorithms can be simulated by MQs with persistent noise. With some modifications BS can also be simulated by MQs with product attribute noise (i.e., for a query x oracle changes every bit of x with some constant probability and calculates the value of the target function at the resulting point) and classification noise. This implies learnability of decision trees and weak learnability of DNF with this non-trivial noise. In the second part of this paper we develop a characterization for learnability with these extended statistical queries. We show that our characterization when applied to SQ-Dp is tight in terms of learning parity functions.

The pseudo posterior synthesizer constructs a weight for each datum record by using the Lipschitz bound for that record under a log-pseudo likelihood utility function that general-izes the exponential mechanism (EM) used to construct a formally private data generating mechanism. By selecting weights to remove likelihood contributions with non-finite log-likelihood values, we guarantee a finite local privacy guarantee for our pseudo posterior mechanism at every sample size.

Given a graphon, we endow the latent space of the nodes with the neighborhood distance. Our complexity index is then based on the covering number and the Minkowksi dimension of this metric space. Although the latent space is not identifiable, these indices turn out to be identifiable. This notion of complexity has simple interpretations on popular examples: it matches the number of communities in stochastic block models; the dimension of the Euclidean space in random geometric graphs; the regularity of the link function in Holder graphons. From a single observation of the graph, we construct an estimator of the neighborhooddistance and show universal non-asymptotic bounds for its risk, matching minimax lower bounds.

We focus on the adjacency-based spectral clustering and for the first step, propose a new data-driven regularization that can restore the concentration of the adjacency matrix even for the sparse networks. This result is based on recent work on regularization of random binary matrices, but avoids using unknown population level parameters, and instead estimates the necessary quantities from the data.

Instead of learning a global behavioral model, recent IRL methods divide the demonstration data into parts, to account for the fact that different trajectories may correspond to different intentions, e.g., because they were generated by different domain experts. In this work, we go one step further: using the intuitive concept of subgoals, we build upon the premise that even a single trajectory can be explained more efficiently locally within a certain context than globally, enabling a more compact representation of the observed behavior. Based on this assumption, we build an implicit intentional model of the agent's goals to forecast its behavior in unobserved situations. The result is an integrated Bayesian prediction framework that significantly outperforms existing IRL solutions and provides smooth policy estimates consistent with the expert's plan. Most notably, our framework naturally handles situations where the intentions of the agent change over time and classical IRL algorithms fail.

These methods divide the data into smaller subsets, sample from the posterior distribution of parameters in parallel on all the subsets, and combine posterior samples from all the subsets to approximate the full data posterior distribution. The smaller size of any subset compared to the full data implies that posterior sampling on any subset is computationally more efficient than sampling from the true posterior distribution. Since the combination step takes negligible time relative to sampling, posterior computations can be scaled to massive data by dividing the full data into sufficiently large number of data subsets. One such approach relies on the geometry of posterior distributions estimated across different subsets and combines them through their barycenter in a Wasserstein space of probability measures.

Using a novel error decomposition which divides the generalization error of DSKRR into the approximation error, sample error and distributed error, we find that the sample error and distributed error reflect the power and limitation of DSKRR, compared with KRR processing the whole data. Thus a small distributed error provides a large range of the number of data subsets to guarantee a small generalization error. Our results show that unlabeled data play important roles in reducing the distributed error and enlarging the number of data subsets in DSKRR.

The present paper continues the same line of study, where we focus on partitioning weighted uniform hypergraphs-a problem often encountered in computer vision. This work is motivated by two issues that arise when a hypergraph partitioning approach is used to tackle computer vision problems: (i) The uniform hypergraphs constructed for higher-order learning contain all edges, but most have negligible weights. Thus, the adjacency tensor is nearly sparse, and yet, not binary. (ii) A more serious concern is that standard partitioning algorithms need to compute all edge weights, which is computationally expensive for hypergraphs. This is usually resolved in practice by merging the clustering algorithm with a tensor sampling strategy-an approach that is yet to be analysed rigorously. We build on our earlier work on partitioning dense unweighted uniform hypergraphs (Ghoshdastidar and Dukkipati, ICML, 2015), and address the aforementioned issues by proposing provable and efficient partitioning algorithms.

Honest workers may be reliable or unreliable, and they provide labels according to an unknown but explicit probabilistic model. Adversaries adopt labeling strategies different from those of honest workers, whether probabilistic or not. We propose two reputation algorithms to identify unreliable honest workers and adversarial workers from only their responses. Our algorithms assume that honest workers are in the majority, and they classify workers with outlier label patterns as adversaries.

In a framework exploiting minimum spanning trees all along, we propose an efficient video segmentation approach that computes temporally consistent pixels in a causal manner, filling the need for causal and real-time applications.

This norm leads to regularized problems that are difficult to optimize, and in this paper, we propose efficient algorithms for solving them. More precisely, we show that the proximal operator associated with this norm is computable exactly via a dual approach that can be viewed as the composition of elementary proximal operators.

We offer the settable systems framework as an extension of the PCM that permits causal discourse in systems embodying optimization, equilibrium, and learning. Because these are common features of physical, natural, or social systems, our framework may prove generally useful for machine learning. Important features distinguishing the settable system framework from the PCM are its countable dimensionality and the use of partitioning and partition-specific response functions to accommodate the behavior of optimizing and interacting agents and to eliminate the requirement of a unique fixed point for the system.

Given an error probability e, together with a method that makes a prediction (y) over bar of a label y, it produces a set of labels, typically containing (y) over bar, that also contains y with probability 1-epsilon. Conformal prediction can be applied to any method for producing (y) over bar: a nearest-neighbor method, a support-vector machine, ridge regression, etc. Conformal prediction is designed for an on-line setting in which labels are predicted successively, each one being revealed before the next is predicted. The most novel and valuable feature of conformal prediction is that if the successive examples are sampled independently from the same distribution, then the successive predictions will be right 1 - epsilon of the time, even though they are based on an accumulating data set rather than on independent data sets. In addition to the model under which successive examples are sampled independently, other on-line compression models can also use conformal prediction. The widely used Gaussian linear model is one of these. This tutorial presents a self-contained account of the theory of conformal prediction and works through several numerical examples.

They are used in most of the existing algorithms for Markov Blanket discovery such as Grow-Shrink or Incremental Association Markov Blanket. One of the most frequently used tests for categorical variables is based on the conditional mutual information (CMI) and its asymptotic distribution. However, it is known that the power of such test dramatically decreases when the size of the conditioning set grows, i.e. the test fails to detect true significant variables, when the set of already selected variables is large. To overcome this drawback for discrete data, we propose to replace the conditional mutual information by Short Expansion of Conditional Mutual Information (called SECMI), obtained by truncating the Mobius representation of CMI. We prove that the distribution of SECMI converges to either a normal distribution or to a distribution of some quadratic form in normal random variables. This property is crucial for the construction of a novel test of conditional independence which uses one of these distributions, chosen in a data dependent way, as a reference under the null hypothesis.

However, standard automated posterior inference algorithms are not tractable at the scale of massive modern data sets, and modifications to make them so are typically model-specific, require expert tuning, and can break theoretical guarantees on inferential quality. Building on the Bayesian coresets framework, this work instead takes advantage of data redundancy to shrink the data set itself as a preprocessing step, providing fully-automated, scalable Bayesian inference with theoretical guarantees. We begin with an intuitive reformulation of Bayesian coreset construction as sparse vector sum approximation, and demonstrate that its automation and performance-based shortcomings arise from the use of the supremum norm. To address these shortcomings we develop Hilbert coresets, i.e., Bayesian coresets constructed under a norm induced by an inner-product on the log-likelihood function space. We propose two Hilbert coreset construction algorithms-one based on importance sampling, and one based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm-along with theoretical guarantees on approximation quality as a function of coreset size. Since the exact computation of the proposed inner-products is model-specific, we automate the construction with a random finite-dimensional projection of the log-likelihood functions. The resulting automated coreset construction algorithm is simple to implement, and experiments on a variety of models with real and synthetic data sets show that it provides high-quality posterior approximations and a significant reduction in the computational cost of inference.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2019,20,,,,,,,,15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000458666500001,0

In statistical physics, while there has been recent interest in representing physical data with generative modelling, the focus has been on shallow neural networks. A natural question to ask is whether deep neural networks hold any advantage over shallow networks in representing such data. We investigate this question by using unsupervised, generative graphical models to learn the probability distribution of a two-dimensional Ising system. Deep Boltzmann machines, deep belief networks, and deep restricted Boltzmann networks are trained on thermal spin configurations from this system, and compared to the shallow architecture of the restricted Boltzmann machine. We benchmark the models, focussing on the accuracy of generating energetic observables near the phase transition, where these quantities are most difficult to approximate. Interestingly, after training the generative networks, we observe that the accuracy essentially depends only on the number of neurons in the first hidden layer of the network, and not on other model details such as network depth or model type.

A user's preferences can be observed either explicitly as in movie ratings or implicitly as in viewing times of news articles. Given such individualized ordinal data in the form of comparisons and choices, we address the problem of collaboratively learning representations of the users and the items. The learned features can be used to predict a user's preference of an unseen item to be used in recommendation systems. This also allows one to compute similarities among users and items to be used for categorization and search. Motivated by the empirical successes of the MultiNomial Logit (MNL) model in marketing and transportation, and also more recent successes in word embedding and crowdsourced image embedding, we pose this problem as learning the MNL model parameters that best explain the data. We propose a convex relaxation for learning the MNL model, and show that it is minimax optimal up to a logarithmic factor by comparing its performance to a fundamental lower bound. This characterizes the minimax sample complexity of the problem, and proves that the proposed estimator cannot be improved upon other than by a logarithmic factor. Further, the analysis identifies how the accuracy depends on the topology of sampling via the spectrum of the sampling graph.

This article introduces a model-free variable selection method via learning the gradient functions. The idea is based on the equivalence between whether a variable is informative and whether its corresponding gradient function is substantially non-zero. The proposed variable selection method is then formulated in a framework of learning gradients in a flexible reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The key advantage of the proposed method is that it requires no explicit model assumption and allows for general variable effects. Its asymptotic estimation and selection consistencies are studied, which establish the convergence rate of the estimated sparse gradients and assure that the truly informative variables are correctly identified in probability. The effectiveness of the proposed method is also supported by a variety of simulated examples and two real-life examples.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2016,17,,,,,,,,82,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000391526300001,0

However, the majority of such approximation approaches are still restricted to nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and suffer from the following two drawbacks: 1) they are unable to produce balanced partitions for large-scale manifold data which are common in real-world clustering tasks; 2) most existing NMF-type clustering methods cannot automatically determine the number of clusters. We propose a new low-rank learning method to address these two problems, which is beyond matrix factorization. Our method approximately decomposes a sparse input similarity in a normalized way and its objective can be used to learn both cluster assignments and the number of clusters. For efficient optimization, we use a relaxed formulation based on Data-Cluster-Data random walk, which is also shown to be equivalent to low-rank factorization of the doubly-stochastically normalized cluster incidence matrix. The probabilistic cluster assignments can thus be learned with a multiplicative majorization-minimization algorithm. Experimental results show that the new method is more accurate both in terms of clustering large-scale manifold data sets and of selecting the number of clusters.",,,,,"Yang, Zhirong/E-8312-2012","Yang, Zhirong/0000-0001-8412-5684",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2016,17,,,,,,,,187,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000391825500001,0

This procedure has an interesting connection to the lasso: under some conditions, it is known that the sequence of forward stagewise estimates exactly coincides with the lasso path, as the step size epsilon goes to zero. Furthermore, essentially the same equivalence holds outside of least squares regression, with the minimization of a differentiable convex loss function subject to an l(1) norm constraint (the stagewise algorithm now updates the coefficient corresponding to the maximal absolute component of the gradient). Even when they do not match their l(1)-constrained analogues, stagewise estimates provide a useful approximation, and are computationally appealing.

Whenever m <= root N, this guarantee matches the best possible rate achievable by a centralized algorithm having access to all N samples. The second algorithm is a novel method, based on an appropriate form of bootstrap subsampling.

We also provide an experimental evaluation of our methods, investigating their performance both on simulated data and on a large-scale regression problem from the internet search domain.

This paper demonstrates that the difficulties in model selection associated with the saddle point property of principal curves are intrinsically tied to the minimization of the mean-squared projection distance. We introduce a new objective function, facilitated through a modification of the principal curve estimation approach, for which all critical points are principal curves and minima.

Applied to classification problems, it provides a lower bound on the Bayes error rate and motivates the widely used Infomax principle. In modern machine learning, we are often interested in more than just the error rate. In medical diagnosis, different errors incur different cost; hence, the overall risk is cost-sensitive. Two other popular criteria are balanced error rate (BER) and F-score. In this work, we focus on the two-class problem and use a general definition of conditional entropy (including Shannon's as a special case) to derive upper/lower bounds on the optimal F-score, BER and cost-sensitive risk, extending Fano's result. As a consequence, we show that Infomax is not suitable for optimizing F-score or cost-sensitive risk, in that it can potentially lead to low F-score and high risk. For cost-sensitive risk, we propose a new conditional entropy formulation which avoids this inconsistency. In addition, we consider the common practice of using a threshold on the posterior probability to tune performance of a classifier.

Our method searches for approximately conserved motifs that occur with varying statistical properties in positive and negative training examples. We propose a two-step process to discover such patterns. Using locality sensitive hashing (LSH), we first estimate the frequency of all subsequences and their approximate matches within a given Hamming radius in labeled examples. The discriminative ability of each pattern is then assessed from the estimated frequencies by concordance and rank sum testing. The use of LSH to identify approximate matches for each candidate pattern helps reduce the runtime of our method. Space requirements are reduced by decomposing the search problem into an iterative method that uses a single LSH table in memory. We propose two further optimizations to the search for discriminative patterns. Clustering with redundancy based on a 2-approximate solution of the k-center problem decreases the number of overlapping approximate groups while providing exhaustive coverage of the search space. Sequential statistical methods allow the search process to use data from only as many training examples as are needed to assess significance. We evaluated our algorithm on data sets from different applications to discover sequential patterns for classification. On nucleotide sequences from the Drosophila genome compared with random background sequences, our method was able to discover approximate binding sites that were preserved upstream of genes. We observed a similar result in experiments on ChIP-on-chip data. For cardiovascular data from patients admitted with acute coronary syndromes, our pattern discovery approach identified approximately conserved sequences of morphology variations that were predictive of future death in a test population. Our data showed that the use of LSH, clustering, and sequential statistics improved the running time of the search algorithm by an order of magnitude without any noticeable effect on accuracy.

For example, in environmental monitoring, we want to select locations to measure in order to most effectively predict spatial phenomena. Often, we want to select observations which are robust against a number of possible objective functions. Examples include minimizing the maximum posterior variance in Gaussian Process regression, robust experimental design, and sensor placement for outbreak detection. In this paper, we present the submodular Saturation algorithm, a simple and efficient algorithm with strong theoretical approximation guarantees for cases where the possible objective functions exhibit submodularity, an intuitive diminishing returns property. Moreover, we prove that better approximation algorithms do not exist unless NP-complete problems admit efficient algorithms. We show how our algorithm can be extended to handle complex cost functions (incorporating non-unit observation cost or communication and path costs). We also show how the algorithm can be used to near-optimally trade off expected-case (e. g., the Mean Square Prediction Error in Gaussian Process regression) and worst- case (e. g., maximum predictive variance) performance. We show that many important machine learning problems fit our robust submodular observation selection formalism, and provide extensive empirical evaluation on several real-world problems. For Gaussian Process regression, our algorithm compares favorably with state-of-the-art heuristics described in the geostatistics literature, while being simpler, faster and providing theoretical guarantees.

A cluster is formed by those sample points that ascend to the same local maximum (mode) of the density function. The path from a point to its associated mode is efficiently solved by an EM-style algorithm, namely, the Modal EM (MEM). This method is then extended for hierarchical clustering by recursively locating modes of kernel density estimators with increasing bandwidths. Without model fitting, the mode-based clustering yields a density description for every cluster, a major advantage of mixture-model-based clustering. Moreover, it ensures that every cluster corresponds to a bump of the density. The issue of diagnosing clustering results is also investigated. Specifically, a pairwise separability measure for clusters is defined using the ridgeline between the density bumps of two clusters. The ridgeline is solved for by the Ridgeline EM (REM) algorithm, an extension of MEM. Based upon this new measure, a cluster merging procedure is created to enforce strong separation. Experiments on simulated and real data demonstrate that the mode-based clustering approach tends to combine the strengths of linkage and mixture-model-based clustering. In addition, the approach is robust in high dimensions and when clusters deviate substantially from Gaussian distributions. Both of these cases pose difficulty for parametric mixture modeling.

We relate Rayleigh's coefficient to a noise model that minimises a cost based on the most probable class centres and that abandons the `regression to the labels' assumption used by other algorithms. Optimisation of the noise model yields a direction of discrimination equivalent to Fisher's discriminant, and with the incorporation of a prior we can apply Bayes' rule to infer the posterior distribution of the direction of discrimination. Nonetheless, we argue that an additional constraining distribution has to be included if sensible results are to be obtained. Going further, with the use of a Gaussian process prior we show the equivalence of our model to a regularised kernel Fisher's discriminant. A key advantage of our approach is the facility to determine kernel parameters and the regularisation coefficient through the optimisation of the marginal log-likelihood of the data.

Here we show that this algorithm outperforms one version of the most powerful set of algorithms for grammatical inference, evidence driven state merging (EDSM), on randomly-generated DFAs. The performance increase is due to the fact that the EDSM algorithm only works well for DFAs with specific balances (percentage of positive labelings), while the EEA is more consistent over a wider range of balances.

Auto-annotation might help organize and access large collections of images. Region naming is a model of object recognition as a process of translating image regions to words, much as one might translate from one language to another. Learning the relationships between image regions and semantic correlates (words) is an interesting example of multi-modal data mining, particularly because it is typically hard to apply data mining techniques to collections of images. We develop a number of models for the joint distribution of image regions and words, including several which explicitly learn the correspondence between regions and words.

Moreover, we show that this optimization approach to training is far more effective at recovering the true support of a given data set, i.e., correctly identifying important features while simultaneously excluding spurious ones. We further compare the robust optimization approach to cross validation and find that optimization continues to have a performance edge albeit smaller. Finally, we show that this optimization approach to training is equivalent to building models that are robust to all subpopulations in the data, and thus in particular are robust to the hardest subpopulation, which leads to interesting domain specific interpretations through the use of optimal classification trees.

We introduce a spatio-temporal product partition model that deals with the regionalization problem in a probabilistic way. Random spanning trees are used as a tool to tackle the problem of searching the space of possible partitions making feasible this exploration. Based on this framework, we propose an efficient Gibbs sampler algorithm to sample from the posterior distribution of the parameters, specially the random partition.

In the planted clustering problem, a random graph is generated based on an underlying cluster structure of the nodes; the task is to recover these clusters given the graph. The submatrix localization problem concerns locating hidden submatrices with elevated means inside a large real-valued random matrix. Of particular interest is the setting where the number of clusters/submatrices is allowed to grow unbounded with the problem size. These formulations cover several classical models such as planted clique, planted densest subgraph, planted partition, planted coloring, and the stochastic block model, which are widely used for studying community detection, graph clustering and bi-clustering. For both problems, we show that the space of the model parameters (cluster/submatrix size, edge probabilities and the mean of the submatrices) can be partitioned into four disjoint regions corresponding to decreasing statistical and computational complexities: (1) the impossible regime, where all algorithms fail; (2) the hard regime, where the computationally expensive Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) succeeds; (3) the easy regime, where the polynomial-time convexified MLE succeeds; (4) the simple regime, where a local counting/thresholding procedure succeeds. Moreover, we show that each of these algorithms provably fails in the harder regimes. Our results establish the minimax recovery limits, which are tight up to universal constants and hold even with a growing number of clusters/submatrices, and provide order-wise stronger performance guarantees for polynomial-time algorithms than previously known. Our study demonstrates the tradeoffs between statistical and computational considerations, and suggests that the minimax limits may not be achievable by polynomial-time algorithms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2016,17,,,,,,,,27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000391477100001,0

In each round it chooses from a time-invariant set of alternatives and receives the payoff associated with this alternative. While the case of small strategy sets is by now well-understood, a lot of recent work has focused on MAB problems with exponentially or infinitely large strategy sets, where one needs to assume extra structure in order to make the problem tractable. In particular, recent literature considered information on similarity between arms. We consider similarity information in the setting of contextual bandits, a natural extension of the basic MAB problem where before each round an algorithm is given the context a hint about the payoffs in this round. Contextual bandits are directly motivated by placing advertisements on web pages, one of the crucial problems in sponsored search. A particularly simple way to represent similarity information in the contextual bandit setting is via a similarity distance between the context-arm pairs which bounds from above the difference between the respective expected payoffs. Prior work on contextual bandits with similarity uses uniform partitions of the similarity space, so that each context-arm pair is approximated by the closest pair in the partition. Algorithms based on uniform partitions disregard the structure of the payoffs and the context arrivals, which is potentially wasteful. We present algorithms that are based on adaptive partitions, and take advantage of benign payoffs and context arrivals without sacrificing the worst-case performance. The central idea is to maintain a finer partition in high-payoff regions of the similarity space and in popular regions of the context space.

This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different thinned networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights.

The continuous model defines each facial expression of emotion as a feature vector in a face space. This model explains, for example, how expressions of emotion can be seen at different intensities. In contrast, the categorical model consists of C classifiers, each tuned to a specific emotion category. This model explains, among other findings, why the images in a morphing sequence between a happy and a surprise face are perceived as either happy or surprise but not something in between. While the continuous model has a more difficult time justifying this latter finding, the categorical model is not as good when it comes to explaining how expressions are recognized at different intensities or modes. Most importantly, both models have problems explaining how one can recognize combinations of emotion categories such as happily surprised versus angrily surprised versus surprise. To resolve these issues, in the past several years, we have worked on a revised model that justifies the results reported in the cognitive science and neuroscience literature. This model consists of C distinct continuous spaces. Multiple (compound) emotion categories can be recognized by linearly combining these C face spaces. The dimensions of these spaces are shown to be mostly configural. According to this model, the major task for the classification of facial expressions of emotion is precise, detailed detection of facial landmarks rather than recognition. We provide an overview of the literature justifying the model, show how the resulting model can be employed to build algorithms for the recognition of facial expression of emotion, and propose research directions in machine learning and computer vision researchers to keep pushing the state of the art in these areas.

In particular, we are considering the situation where the model probability density function is unnormalized. That is, the model is only specified up to the partition function. The partition function normalizes a model so that it integrates to one for any choice of the parameters. However, it is often impossible to obtain it in closed form. Gibbs distributions, Markov and multi-layer networks are examples of models where analytical normalization is often impossible. Maximum likelihood estimation can then not be used without resorting to numerical approximations which are often computationally expensive. We propose here a new objective function for the estimation of both normalized and unnormalized models. The basic idea is to perform nonlinear logistic regression to discriminate between the observed data and some artificially generated noise. With this approach, the normalizing partition function can be estimated like any other parameter. We prove that the new estimation method leads to a consistent (convergent) estimator of the parameters. For large noise sample sizes, the new estimator is furthermore shown to behave like the maximum likelihood estimator. In the estimation of unnormalized models, there is a trade-off between statistical and computational performance. We show that the new method strikes a competitive trade-off in comparison to other estimation methods for unnormalized models. As an application to real data, we estimate novel two-layer models of natural image statistics with spline nonlinearities.",,,,,,"Hyvarinen, Aapo/0000-0002-5806-4432",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,FEB,2012,13,,,,,,307,361,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000303046000004,0

In this paper, we demonstrate that HIK can be used in an unsupervised manner to significantly improve the generation of visual codebooks. We propose a histogram kernel k-means algorithm which is easy to implement and runs almost as fast as the standard k-means. The HIK codebooks have consistently higher recognition accuracy over k-means codebooks by 2-4% in several benchmark object and scene recognition data sets.

The present contribution describes a machine learning approach termed MINLIP. The key insight is to relate ranking criteria as the Area Under the Curve to monotone transformation functions. Consequently, the notion of a Lipschitz smoothness constant is found to be useful for complexity control for learning transformation models, much in a similar vein as the 'margin' is for Support Vector Machines for classification. The use of this model structure in the context of high dimensional data, as well as for estimating non-linear, and additive models based on primal-dual kernel machines, and for sparse models is indicated. Given n observations, the present method solves a quadratic program existing of O(n) constraints and O(n) unknowns, where most existing risk minimization approaches to ranking problems typically result in algorithms with O(n(2)) constraints or unknowns. We specify the MINLIP method for three different cases: the first one concerns the preference learning problem. Secondly it is specified how to adapt the method to ordinal regression with a finite set of ordered outcomes. Finally, it is shown how the method can be used in the context of survival analysis where one models failure times, typically subject to censoring. The current approach is found to be particularly useful in this context as it can handle, in contrast with the standard statistical model for analyzing survival data, all types of censoring in a straightforward way, and because of the explicit relation with the Proportional Hazard and Accelerated Failure Time models. The advantage of the current method is illustrated on different benchmark data sets, as well as for estimating a model for cancer survival based on different micro-array and clinical data sets.",,,,,"Pelckmans, Kristiaan/A-3118-2013; Suykens, Johan A.K./C-9781-2014","Suykens, Johan A.K./0000-0002-8846-6352",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,MAR,2011,12,,,,,,819,862,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000289635000004,0

However, there are many practical situations where the training data show some dependencies and where the traditional IID assumption does not hold. Stating generalization bounds for such frameworks is therefore of the utmost interest, both from theoretical and practical standpoints. In this work, we propose the first-to the best of our knowledge-PAC-Bayes generalization bounds for classifiers trained on data exhibiting interdependencies. The approach undertaken to establish our results is based on the decomposition of a so-called dependency graph that encodes the dependencies within the data, in sets of independent data, thanks to graph fractional covers. Our bounds are very general, since being able to find an upper bound on the fractional chromatic number of the dependency graph is sufficient to get new PAC-Bayes bounds for specific settings. We show how our results can be used to derive bounds for ranking statistics (such as AUC) and classifiers trained on data distributed according to a stationary beta-mixing process. In the way, we show how our approach seamlessly allows us to deal with U-processes.

In addition, how can we do so with a mathematically tractable model that allows for rigorous analysis of network properties? Real networks exhibit a long list of surprising properties: Heavy tails for the in-and out-degree distribution, heavy tails for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, small diameters, and densification and shrinking diameters over time. Current network models and generators either fail to match several of the above properties, are complicated to analyze mathematically, or both. Here we propose a generative model for networks that is both mathematically tractable and can generate networks that have all the above mentioned structural properties. Our main idea here is to use a non-standard matrix operation, the Kronecker product, to generate graphs which we refer to as Kronecker graphs. First, we show that Kronecker graphs naturally obey common network properties. In fact, we rigorously prove that they do so. We also provide empirical evidence showing that Kronecker graphs can effectively model the structure of real networks. We then present KRONFIT, a fast and scalable algorithm for fitting the Kronecker graph generation model to large real networks. A naive approach to fitting would take super-exponential time. In contrast, KRONFIT takes linear time, by exploiting the structure of Kronecker matrix multiplication and by using statistical simulation techniques. Experiments on a wide range of large real and synthetic networks show that KRONFIT finds accurate parameters that very well mimic the properties of target networks. In fact, using just four parameters we can accurately model several aspects of global network structure. Once fitted, the model parameters can be used to gain insights about the network structure, and the resulting synthetic graphs can be used for null-models, anonymization, extrapolations, and graph summarization.",,,,,,"Faloutsos, Christos/0000-0003-2996-9790; Chakrabarti, Deepayan/0000-0002-3863-4928; Leskovec, Jure/0000-0002-5411-923X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,FEB,2010,11,,,,,,985,1042,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000277186500021,0

For this purpose we employ a novel formulation of tensor voting, which allows an N-D implementation. Tensor voting is a perceptual organization framework that has mostly been applied to computer vision problems. Analyzing the estimated local structure at the inputs, we are able to obtain reliable dimensionality estimates at each instance, instead of a global estimate for the entire data set. Moreover, these local dimensionality and structure estimates enable us to measure geodesic distances and perform nonlinear interpolation for data sets with varying density, outliers, perturbation and intersections, that cannot be handled by state-of-the-art methods. Quantitative results on the estimation of local manifold structure using ground truth data are presented.

Given that the true class should be included in predictions and the number of classes predicted should be as small as possible, these kind of classifiers can be considered as Information Retrieval (IR) procedures. In this paper, we propose a family of IR loss functions to measure the performance of nondeterministic learners. After discussing such measures, we derive an algorithm for learning optimal nondeterministic hypotheses. Given an entry from the input space, the algorithm requires the posterior probabilities to compute the subset of classes with the lowest expected loss. From a general point of view, nondeterministic classifiers provide an improvement in the proportion of predictions that include the true class compared to their deterministic counterparts; the price to be paid for this increase is usually a tiny proportion of predictions with more than one class. The paper includes an extensive experimental study using three deterministic learners to estimate posterior probabilities: a multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM), a Logistic Regression, and a Naive Bayes.

Therefore, the search space of Bayesian network structures may be organized in equivalence classes, where each of them represents a different set of conditional independencies.

This paper discusses in depth the role that the inclusion order plays in learning the structure of Bayesian networks. In particular, this role involves the way a learning algorithm traverses the search space. We introduce a condition for traversal operators, the inclusion boundary condition, which, when it is satisfied, guarantees that the search strategy can avoid local maxima. This is proved under the assumptions that the data is sampled from a probability distribution which is faithful to an acyclic digraph, and the length of the sample is unbounded. The previous discussion leads to the design of a new traversal operator and two new learning algorithms in the context of heuristic search and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method.

Such irrelevant information can, and typically does, hinder an ILP system's search for good models. Here, we provide evidence that if expertise is available that can provide a partial-ordering on sets of background predicates in terms of relevance to the analysis task, then this can be used to good effect by an ILP system. In particular, using data from biochemical domains, we investigate an incremental strategy of including sets of predicates in decreasing order of relevance. Results obtained suggest that: (a) the incremental approach identifies, in substantially less time, a model that is comparable in predictive accuracy to that obtained with all background information in place; and (b) the incremental approach using the relevance ordering performs better than one that does not (that is, one that adds sets of predicates randomly). For a practitioner concerned with use of ILP, the implication of these findings are twofold: (1) when not all background information can be used at once (either due to limitations of the ILP system, or the nature of the domain) expert assessment of the relevance of background predicates can assist substantially in the construction of good models; and (2) good first-cut results can be obtained quickly by a simple exclusion of information known to be less relevant.",,,,,,"King, Ross/0000-0001-7208-4387",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,Apr-01,2004,4,3,,,,,369,383,,10.1162/153244304773633861,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000221043900006,0

However, the exact tradeoff between fairness and accuracy is not entirely clear, even for the basic paradigm of classification problems. In this paper, we characterize an inherent tradeoff between statistical parity and accuracy in the classification setting by providing a lower bound on the sum of group-wise errors of any fair classifiers. Our impossibility theorem could be interpreted as a certain uncertainty principle in fairness: if the base rates differ among groups, then any fair classifier satisfying statistical parity has to incur a large error on at least one of the groups. We further extend this result to give a lower bound on the joint error of any (approximately) fair classifiers, from the perspective of learning fair representations. To show that our lower bound is tight, assuming oracle access to Bayes (potentially unfair) classifiers, we also construct an algorithm that returns a randomized classifier which is both optimal (in terms of accuracy) and fair. Interestingly, when the protected attribute can take more than two values, an extension of this lower bound does not admit an analytic solution. Nevertheless, in this case, we show that the lower bound can be efficiently computed by solving a linear program, which we term as the TV-Barycenter problem, a barycenter problem under the TV-distance. On the upside, we prove that if the group-wise Bayes optimal classifiers are close, then learning fair representations leads to an alternative notion of fairness, known as the accuracy parity, which states that the error rates are close between groups. Finally, we also conduct experiments on real-world datasets to confirm our theoretical findings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2022,23,,,,,,1,26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000752282900001,0

From these finite-sample bounds it follows that the classical discrepancy principle is statistically adaptive for slow rates occurring in the hard learning scenario, while the smoothed discrepancy principles are adaptive over ranges of faster rates (resp. higher smoothness parameters).

Introducing stochasticity is key to their success in practical problems, and there is some understanding of the role of stochastic gradient descent in this context. Momentum modifications of gradient descent such as Polyak's Heavy Ball method (HB) and Nesterov's method of accelerated gradients (NAG), are also widely adopted. In this work our focus is on understanding the role of momentum in the training of neural networks, concentrating on the common situation in which the momentum contribution is fixed at each step of the algorithm. To expose the ideas simply we work in the deterministic setting. Our approach is to derive continuous time approximations of the discrete algorithms; these continuous time approximations provide insights into the mechanisms at play within the discrete algorithms. We prove three such approximations. Firstly we show that standard implementations of fixed momentum methods approximate a time-rescaled gradient descent flow, asymptotically as the learning rate shrinks to zero; this result does not distinguish momentum methods from pure gradient descent, in the limit of vanishing learning rate. We then proceed to prove two results aimed at understanding the observed practical advantages of fixed momentum methods over gradient descent, when implemented in the non-asymptotic regime with fixed small, but non-zero, learning rate. We achieve this by proving approximations to continuous time limits in which the small but fixed learning rate appears as a parameter; this is known as the method of modified equations in the numerical analysis literature, recently rediscovered as the high resolution ODE approximation in the machine learning context. In our second result we show that the momentum method is approximated by a continuous time gradient flow, with an additional momentum-dependent second order time-derivative correction, proportional to the learning rate; this may be used to explain the stabilizing effect of momentum algorithms in their transient phase. Furthermore in a third result we show that the momentum methods admit an exponentially attractive invariant manifold on which the dynamics reduces, approximately, to a gradient flow with respect to a modified loss function, equal to the original loss function plus a small perturbation proportional to the learning rate; this small correction provides convexification of the loss function and encodes additional robustness present in momentum methods, beyond the transient phase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2021,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000628529500017,0

An individualized treatment rule formalizes precision medicine as a map from patient information to a recommended treatment. A treatment rule is defined to be optimal if it maximizes the mean of a scalar outcome in a population of interest, e.g., symptom reduction. However, clinical and intervention scientists often seek to balance multiple and possibly competing outcomes, e.g., symptom reduction and the risk of an adverse event. One approach to precision medicine in this setting is to elicit a composite outcome which balances all competing outcomes; unfortunately, eliciting a composite outcome directly from patients is difficult without a high-quality instrument, and an expert-derived composite outcome may not account for heterogeneity in patient preferences. We propose a new paradigm for the study of precision medicine using observational data that relies solely on the assumption that clinicians are approximately (i.e., imperfectly) making decisions to maximize individual patient utility. Estimated composite outcomes are subsequently used to construct an estimator of an individualized treatment rule which maximizes the mean of patient-specific composite outcomes. The estimated composite outcomes and estimated optimal individualized treatment rule provide new insights into patient preference heterogeneity, clinician behavior, and the value of precision medicine in a given domain.

We formulate a natural approach for solving this problem, which works with angular embeddings of the noisy mod 1 samples over the unit circle, inspired by the angular synchronization framework. This amounts to solving a smoothness regularized least-squares problem - a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) - where the variables are constrained to lie on the unit circle. Our proposed approach is based on solving its relaxation, which is a trust-region sub-problem and hence solvable efficiently. We provide theoretical guarantees demonstrating its robustness to noise for adversarial, as well as random Gaussian and Bernoulli noise models.

We demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our proposed approach via extensive numerical simulations on synthetic data, along with a simple least-squares based solution for the unwrapping stage, that recovers the original samples of f (up to a global shift). It is shown to perform well at high levels of noise, when taking as input the denoised modulo 1 samples.

To address this shortfall, we start by formulating an ideal definition of difficulty score - the loss of the optimal hypothesis at a given datapoint. We analyze the possible contribution of curriculum learning based on this score in two convex problems linear regression, and binary classification by hinge loss minimization. We show that in both cases, the convergence rate of SGD optimization decreases monotonically with the difficulty score, in accordance with earlier empirical results. We also prove that when the difficulty score is fixed, the convergence rate of SGD optimization is monotonically increasing with respect to the loss of the current hypothesis at each point. We discuss how these results settle some confusion in the literature where two apparently opposing heuristics are reported to improve performance: curriculum learning in which easier points are given priority, vs hard data mining where the more difficult points are sought out.",,,,,,"Amir, Dan/0000-0002-3518-5346",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2020,21,,,,,,,,222,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000605742600001,0

The classifier is called pointwise-competitive if it classifies each point identically to the best classifier in hindsight (from the same class), whenever it does not abstain. The quality of such a classifier is quantified by its rejection mass, defined to be the probability mass of the points it rejects. A fast rejection rate is achieved if the rejection mass is bounded from above by (O) over tilde (1/m) where m is the number of labeled examples used to train the classifier (and (O) over tilde hides logarithmic factors). Pointwise-competitive selective (PCS) classifiers are intimately related to disagreement-based active learning and it is known that in the realizable case, a fast rejection rate of a known PCS algorithm (called Consistent Selective Strategy) is equivalent to an exponential speedup of the well-known CAL active algorithm. We focus on the agnostic setting, for which there is a known algorithm called LESS that learns a PCS classifier and achieves a fast rejection rate (depending on Hanneke's disagreement coefficient) under strong assumptions. We present an improved PCS learning algorithm called ILESS for which we show a fast rate (depending on Hanneke's disagreement coefficient) without any assumptions. Our rejection bound smoothly interpolates the realizable and agnostic settings. The main result of this paper is an equivalence between the following three entities: (i) the existence of a fast rejection rate for any PCS learning algorithm (such as ILESS); (ii) a poly-logarithmic bound for Hanneke's disagreement coefficient; and (iii) an exponential speedup for a new disagreement-based active learner called Active-ILESS.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2019,20,,,,,,,,33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000463316900001,0

We report an unexpected finding: when data contains (greater than zero-dimensional) manifolds, the SDP solution captures such geometrical structures. Unlike traditional manifold embedding techniques, our approach does not rely on manually defining a kernel but rather enforces locality via a nonnegativity constraint. We thus call our approach NOnnegative MAnifold Disentangling, or NOMAD. To build an intuitive understanding of its manifold learning capabilities, we develop a theoretical analysis of NOMAD on idealized datasets. While NOMAD is convex and the globally optimal solution can be found by generic SDP solvers with polynomial time complexity, they are too slow for modern datasets.

In this paper we design a distributed algorithm for l(1) regularization that is much better suited for such systems than existing algorithms. A careful cost analysis is used to support these points and motivate our method. The main idea of our algorithm is to do block optimization of many variables on the actual objective function within each computing node; this increases the computational cost per step that is matched with the communication cost, and decreases the number of outer iterations, thus yielding a faster overall method.

To do this, we first introduce a new population measure of dependence and show three equivalent ways that it can be viewed, including as a canonical smoothing of mutual information. We then introduce an efficiently computable consistent estimator of our population measure of dependence, and we empirically establish its equitability on a large class of noisy functional relationships. This new statistic has better bias/variance properties and better runtime complexity than a previous heuristic approach. Next, we derive a second, related statistic whose computation is a trivial side-product of our algorithm and whose goal is powerful independence testing rather than equitability. We prove that this statistic yields a consistent independence test and show in simulations that the test has good power against independence. Taken together, our results suggest that these two statistics are a valuable pair of tools for exploratory data analysis.",,,,,"Sabeti, Pardis/GQH-8610-2022",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2016,17,,,,,,1,63,211,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000391835000001,0

Uniqueness of Tensor Tucker Decompositions with Structured Sparsity,JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,"Overcomplete latent representations have been very popular for unsupervised feature learning in recent years. In this paper, we specify which overcomplete models can be identified given observable moments of a certain order. We consider probabilistic admixture or topic models in the overcomplete regime, where the number of latent topics can greatly exceed the size of the observed word vocabulary. While general overcomplete topic models are not identifiable, we establish generic identifiability under a constraint, referred to as topic persistence. Our sufficient conditions for identifiability involve a novel set of higher order expansion conditions on the topic-word matrix or the population structure of the model. This set of higher-order expansion conditions allow for overcomplete models, and require the existence of a perfect matching from latent topics to higher order observed words. We establish that random structured topic models are identifiable w.h.p. in the overcomplete regime. Our identifiability results allows for general (non-degenerate) distributions for modeling the topic proportions, and thus, we can handle arbitrarily correlated topics in our framework. Our identifiability results imply uniqueness of a class of tensor decompositions with structured sparsity which is contained in the class of Tucker decompositions, but is more general than the Candecomp/Parafac (CP) decomposition.",,,,,,"Hsu, Daniel/0000-0002-3495-7113",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,DEC,2015,16,,,,,,2643,2694,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000369888000011,0

A detailed analysis of the generalized spike-and-slab prior shows that it is well suited for regression problems that are sparse at the group level. Furthermore, this prior can be used to introduce prior knowledge about specific groups of features that are a priori believed to be more relevant.

It is noteworthy that samples in this learning process are not independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.). Therefore, results in traditional statistical learning theory are not applicable (or at least cannot be applied directly), because they are obtained under the sample-i.i.d. assumption.

Discriminative algorithms often work best with highly-informative features; remarkably, such features can often be learned without the labels. One particularly effective way to perform such unsupervised learning has been to use autoencoder neural networks, which find latent representations that are constrained but nevertheless informative for reconstruction. However, pure unsupervised learning with autoencoders can find representations that may or may not be useful for the ultimate discriminative task. It is a continuing challenge to guide the training of an autoencoder so that it finds features which will be useful for predicting labels. Similarly, we often have a priori information regarding what statistical variation will be irrelevant to the ultimate discriminative task, and we would like to be able to use this for guidance as well. Although a typical strategy would be to include a parametric discriminative model as part of the autoencoder training, here we propose a nonparametric approach that uses a Gaussian process to guide the representation. By using a nonparametric model, we can ensure that a useful discriminative function exists for a given set of features, without explicitly instantiating it. We demonstrate the superiority of this guidance mechanism on four data sets, including a real- world application to rehabilitation research. We also show how our proposed approach can learn to explicitly ignore statistically significant covariate information that is label-irrelevant, by evaluating on the small NORB image recognition problem in which pose and lighting labels are available.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,SEP,2012,13,,,,,,2567,2588,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000309580600003,0

The trace-norm shrinkage is simply induced by non-flat prior information, similarly to the maximum a posteriori (MAP) approach. Thus, no trace-norm shrinkage remains when priors are non-informative. On the other hand, we show a counter-intuitive fact that the PJS shrinkage factor is kept activated even with flat priors. This is shown to be induced by the non-identifiability of the matrix factorization model, that is, the mapping between the target matrix and factorized matrices is not one-to-one.

We are interested in the relations between these problems and between their solutions, as well as in characterizing the cases when a solution exists and finding these solutions. We show that if the quality of prediction is measured using the total variation distance, then these problems coincide, while if it is measured using the expected average KL divergence, then they are different. For some of the formalizations we also show that when a solution exists it can be obtained as a Bayes mixture over a countable subset of C. We also obtain several characterization of those sets C for which solutions to the considered problems exist. As an illustration to the general results obtained, we show that a solution to the non-realizable case of the sequence prediction problem exists for the set of all finite-memory processes, but does not exist for the set of all stationary processes.

For example, learning to play RoboCup Keepaway should contribute to learning the full game of RoboCup soccer. Previous approaches to transfer in Keepaway have focused on transforming the original representation to fit the new task. In contrast, this paper explores the idea that transfer is most effective if the representation is designed to be the same even across different tasks. To demonstrate this point, a bird's eye view (BEV) representation is introduced that can represent different tasks on the same two-dimensional map. For example, both the 3 vs. 2 and 4 vs. 3 Keepaway tasks can be represented on the same BEV. Yet the problem is that a raw two-dimensional map is high-dimensional and unstructured. This paper shows how this problem is addressed naturally by an idea from evolutionary computation called indirect encoding, which compresses the representation by exploiting its geometry. The result is that the BEV learns a Keepaway policy that transfers without further learning or manipulation. It also facilitates transferring knowledge learned in a different domain, Knight Joust, into Keepaway.

We investigate the learning of sparse class indices to address this challenge. An index is a mapping from features to classes. We compare the index-learning methods against other techniques, including one-versus-rest and top-down classification using perceptrons and support vector machines. We find that index learning is highly advantageous for space and time efficiency, at both training and classification times. Moreover, this approach yields similar and at times better accuracies. On problems with hundreds of thousands of instances and thousands of classes, the index is learned in minutes, while other methods can take hours or days. As we explain, the design of the learning update enables conveniently constraining each feature to connect to a small subset of the classes in the index. This constraint is crucial for scalability.

This paper bridges these two trends by introducing nonextensive information theoretic kernels on probability measures, based on new JS-type divergences. These new divergences result from extending the the two building blocks of the classical JS divergence: convexity and Shannon's entropy. The notion of convexity is extended to the wider concept of q-convexity, for which we prove a Jensen q-inequality. Based on this inequality, we introduce Jensen-Tsallis (JT) q-differences, a nonextensive generalization of the JS divergence, and define a k-th order JT q-difference between stochastic processes.

Recently, active learning methods using importance-weighted least-squares learning have been proposed, which are shown to be robust against misspecification of models. In this paper, we propose a new active learning method also using the weighted least-squares learning, which we call ALICE ( Active Learning using the Importance-weighted least-squares learning based on Conditional Expectation of the generalization error). An important difference from existing methods is that we predict the conditional expectation of the generalization error given training input points, while existing methods predict the full expectation of the generalization error. Due to this difference, the training input design can be fine-tuned depending on the realization of training input points. Theoretically, we prove that the proposed active learning criterion is a more accurate predictor of the single-trial generalization error than the existing criterion.

For large input dimension the parameter trajectory of both algorithms passes through a sequence of unstable fixed points, each described by a diffusion process in a polynomial potential. Choosing the learning rate too large increases the escape time from each of these fixed points, effectively trapping the learning in a sub-optimal state. In order to avoid these trapping states a very low learning rate must be chosen during the learning transient, resulting in learning time-scales of O(N-2) or O(N-3) iterations where N is the data dimension. Escape from each sub-optimal state results in a sequence of symmetry breaking events as the algorithm learns each source in turn.

Our starting point is a generalized notion of the margin to multiclass problems. Using this notion we cast multiclass categorization problems as a constrained optimization problem with a quadratic objective function. Unlike most of previous approaches which typically decompose a multiclass problem into multiple independent binary classification tasks, our notion of margin yields a direct method for training multiclass predictors. By using the dual of the optimization problem we are able to incorporate kernels with a compact set of constraints and decompose the dual problem into multiple optimization problems of reduced size. We describe an efficient fixed-point algorithm for solving the reduced optimization problems and prove its convergence. We then discuss technical details that yield significant running time improvements for large datasets. Finally, we describe various experiments with our approach comparing it to previously studied kernel-based methods.

In addition, our bundle includes linear approximations computed at the current iterate and other linear estimates of the DNN parameters. The use of these additional approximations makes our method significantly more robust to its hyperparameters.

An information state always leads to a dynamic programming decomposition. Our key result is to show that if a function of the history (called approximate information state (AIS)) approximately satisfies the properties of the information state, then there is a corresponding approximate dynamic program. We show that the policy computed using this is approximately optimal with bounded loss of optimality. We show that several approximations in state, observation and action spaces in literature can be viewed as instances of AIS. In some of these cases, we obtain tighter bounds.

In this paper we study the feasibility of adversarially robust learning from the perspective of computational learning theory, considering both sample and computational complexity. In particular, our definition of robust learnability requires polynomial sample complexity. We start with two negative results. We show that no non-trivial concept class can be robustly learned in the distribution-free setting against an adversary who can perturb just a single input bit. We show, moreover, that the class of monotone conjunctions cannot be robustly learned under the uniform distribution against an adversary who can perturb omega(log n) input bits. However, we also show that if the adversary is restricted to perturbing O(log n) bits, then one can robustly learn the class of 1-decision lists (which subsumes monotone conjunctions) with respect to the class of log-Lipschitz distributions. We then extend this result to show learnability of 2-decision lists and monotone k-decision lists in the same distributional and adversarial setting. Finally, we provide a simple proof of the computational hardness of robust learning on the boolean hypercube. Unlike previous results of this nature, our result does not rely on a more restricted model of learning, such as the statistical query model, nor on any hardness assumption other than the existence of an (average-case) hard learning problem in the PAC framework; this allows us to have a clean proof of the reduction, and the assumption is no stronger than assumptions that are used to build cryptographic primitives.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2021,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000726667000001,0

We show that NEU can learn any feature map with these two properties if that feature map is asymptotically deformable into the identity.

The latter is used in order to define the adaptive regularization. The bounds resulting from our technique are valid uniformly over all observation points and all time steps, and are compared against the literature with numerical experiments. Finally, the potential of these tools is illustrated by an application to kernelized bandits, where we revisit the Kernel UCB and Kernel Thompson Sampling procedures, and show the benefits of the novel adaptive kernel tuning strategy.",,,,,,"Salguero Tejada, Carlos/0000-0003-0930-9277",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2018,19,,,,,,,,17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000443226600001,0

One particularly useful application of dimensionality reduction techniques is in data visualization. Low-dimensional visualizations can help practitioners understand where machine learning algorithms might leverage the geometric properties of a dataset to improve performance. Another challenge is to generalize insights across datasets [e.g. data from multiple modalities describing the same system (Haxby et al., 2011), artwork or photographs of similar content in different styles (Zhu et al., 2017), etc.]. Several recently developed techniques (e.g. Haxby et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2015) use the procrustean transformation (Schonemann, 1966) to align the geometries of two or more spaces so that data with different axes may be plotted in a common space.

J,"Park, C; Apley, D",,,,"Park, Chiwoo; Apley, Daniel",,,Patchwork Kriging for Large-scale Gaussian Process Regression,JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,"This paper presents a new approach for Gaussian process (GP) regression for large datasets. The approach involves partitioning the regression input domain into multiple local regions with a different local GP model fitted in each region. Unlike existing local partitioned GP approaches, we introduce a technique for patching together the local GP models nearly seamlessly to ensure that the local GP models for two neighboring regions produce nearly the same response prediction and prediction error variance on the boundary between the two regions. This largely mitigates the well-known discontinuity problem that degrades the prediction accuracy of existing local partitioned GP methods over regional boundaries. Our main innovation is to represent the continuity conditions as additional pseudo-observations that the differences between neighboring GP responses are identically zero at an appropriately chosen set of boundary input locations. To predict the response at any input location, we simply augment the actual response observations with the pseudo-observations and apply standard GP prediction methods to the augmented data. In contrast to heuristic continuity adjustments, this has an advantage of working within a formal GP framework, so that the GP-based predictive uncertainty quantification remains valid. Our approach also inherits a sparse block-like structure for the sample covariance matrix, which results in computationally efficient closed-form expressions for the predictive mean and variance. In addition, we provide a new spatial partitioning scheme based on a recursive space partitioning along local principal component directions, which makes the proposed approach applicable for regression domains having more than two dimensions. Using three spatial datasets and three higher dimensional datasets, we investigate the numerical performance of the approach and compare it to several state-of-the-art approaches.",,,,,"Park, Chiwoo/ABA-4876-2021; Apley, Daniel/B-7454-2009","Park, Chiwoo/0000-0002-2463-8901; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2018,19,,,,,,,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000443222900001,0

Classical approaches are typically designed for the case in which the subspace dimension is small relative to the ambient dimension. Our approach works with a dual representation of the subspace and hence aims to find its orthogonal complement; as such, it is particularly suitable for subspaces whose dimension is close to the ambient dimension (subspaces of high relative dimension). We pose the problem of computing normal vectors to the inlier subspace as a non-convex l(1) minimization problem on the sphere, which we call Dual Principal Component Pursuit (DPCP) problem. We provide theoretical guarantees under which every global solution to DPCP is a vector in the orthogonal complement of the inlier subspace. Moreover, we relax the non-convex DPCP problem to a recursion of linear programs whose solutions are shown to converge in a finite number of steps to a vector orthogonal to the subspace. In particular, when the inlier subspace is a hyperplane, the solutions to the recursion of linear programs converge to the global minimum of the non-convex DPCP problem in a finite number of steps. We also propose algorithms based on alternating minimization and iteratively re-weighted least squares, which are suitable for dealing with large-scale data. Experiments on synthetic data show that the proposed methods are able to handle more outliers and higher relative dimensions than current state-of-the-art methods, while experiments in the context of the three-view geometry problem in computer vision suggest that the proposed methods can be a useful or even superior alternative to traditional RANSAC-based approaches for computer vision and other applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2018,19,,,,,,,,18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000443227200001,0

The conventional local GP approach first partitions a domain into multiple non-overlapping local regions, and then fits an independent GP regression for each local region using the training data belonging to the region. Two key issues with the local GP are (1) the prediction around the boundary of a local region is not as accurate as the prediction at interior of the local region, and (2) two local GP regressions for two neighboring local regions produce different predictions at the boundary of the two regions, creating undesirable discontinuity in the prediction. We address these issues by constraining the predictions of local GP regressions sharing a common boundary to satisfy the same boundary constraints, which in turn are estimated by the data.

Our goal in this paper is to develop a method for collecting data for which the least squares estimator for the ranking problem has maximal Fisher information. Our approach, based on experimental design, is to view data collection as a bi-level optimization problem where the inner problem is the ranking problem and the outer problem is to identify data which maximizes the informativeness of the ranking. Under certain assumptions, the data collection problem decouples, reducing to a problem of finding multigraphs with large algebraic connectivity. This reduction of the data collection problem to graph-theoretic questions is one of the primary contributions of this work. As an application, we study the Yahoo! Movie user rating data set and demonstrate that the addition of a small number of well-chosen pairwise comparisons can significantly increase the Fisher informativeness of the ranking. As another application, we study the 2011-12 NCAA football schedule and propose schedules with the same number of games which are significantly more informative. Using spectral clustering methods to identify highly-connected communities within the division, we argue that the NCAA could improve its notoriously poor rankings by simply scheduling more out-of-conference games.",,,,,"Brune, Christoph/C-1700-2013","Brune, Christoph/0000-0003-0145-5069",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,OCT,2014,15,,,,,,2981,3012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000344638800005,0

Exact inference is frequently intractable, so approximate inference is often performed using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). To achieve the best possible results from MCMC, we want to efficiently simulate many steps of a rapidly mixing Markov chain which leaves the target distribution invariant. Of particular interest in this regard is how to take advantage of multi-core computing to speed up MCMC-based inference, both to improve mixing and to distribute the computational load. In this paper, we present a parallelizable Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for efficiently sampling from continuous probability distributions that can take advantage of hundreds of cores. This method shares information between parallel Markov chains to build a scale-location mixture of Gaussians approximation to the density function of the target distribution. We combine this approximation with a recently developed method known as elliptical slice sampling to create a Markov chain with no step-size parameters that can mix rapidly without requiring gradient or curvature computations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,JUN,2014,15,,,,,,2087,2112,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000344638300007,0

To validate our hypothesis we provide theoretical statements about the LSTD value approximation error and induced metric of approximation spaces constructed by SFA and the state-of-the-art methods Krylov bases and proto-value functions (PVF). In particular, we prove that SFA minimizes the average (over all tasks in the same environment) bound on the above approximation error.

They concluded that a carefully designed coordinate descent implementation CDN is the fastest among state-of-the-art solvers. In this paper, we point out that CDN is less competitive on loss functions that are expensive to compute. In particular, CDN for logistic regression is much slower than CDN for SVM because the logistic loss involves expensive exp/log operations. In optimization, Newton methods are known to have fewer iterations although each iteration costs more. Because solving the Newton sub-problem is independent of the loss calculation, this type of methods may surpass CDN under some circumstances. In L1-regularized classification, GLMNET by Friedman et al. is already a Newton-type method, but experiments in Yuan et al. (2010) indicated that the existing GLMNET implementation may face difficulties for some large-scale problems. In this paper, we propose an improved GLMNET to address some theoretical and implementation issues. In particular, as a Newton-type method, GLMNET achieves fast local convergence, but may fail to quickly obtain a useful solution. By a careful design to adjust the effort for each iteration, our method is efficient for both loosely or strictly solving the optimization problem.

This is in response to the question: what are the implicit statistical assumptions of feature selection criteria based on mutual information?. To answer this, we adopt a different strategy than is usual in the feature selection literature-instead of trying to define a criterion, we derive one, directly from a clearly specified objective function: the conditional likelihood of the training labels. While many hand-designed heuristic criteria try to optimize a definition of feature 'relevancy' and 'redundancy', our approach leads to a probabilistic framework which naturally incorporates these concepts. As a result we can unify the numerous criteria published over the last two decades, and show them to be low-order approximations to the exact (but intractable) optimisation problem. The primary contribution is to show that common heuristics for information based feature selection (including Markov Blanket algorithms as a special case) are approximate iterative maximisers of the conditional likelihood. A large empirical study provides strong evidence to favour certain classes of criteria, in particular those that balance the relative size of the relevancy/redundancy terms.

After surveying prior work, we present NetKit, a modular toolkit for classification in networked data, and a case-study of its application to networked data used in prior machine learning research. NetKit is based on a node-centric framework in which classifiers comprise a local classifier, a relational classifier, and a collective inference procedure. Various existing node-centric relational learning algorithms can be instantiated with appropriate choices for these components, and new combinations of components realize new algorithms. The case study focuses on univariate network classification, for which the only information used is the structure of class linkage in the network (i.e., only links and some class labels). To our knowledge, no work previously has evaluated systematically the power of class-linkage alone for classification in machine learning benchmark data sets. The results demonstrate that very simple network-classification models perform quite well-well enough that they should be used regularly as baseline classifiers for studies of learning with networked data. The simplest method (which performs remarkably well) highlights the close correspondence between several existing methods introduced for different purposes-that is, Gaussian-field classifiers, Hopfield networks, and relational-neighbor classifiers. The case study also shows that there are two sets of techniques that are preferable in different situations, namely when few versus many labels are known initially.

The first kind of overlearning results in the generation of spike-like signals, if there are not enough samples in the data or there is a considerable amount of noise present. It is argued that, if the data has power spectrum characterised by 1/f curve, we face a more severe problem, which cannot be solved inside the strict ICA model. This overlearning is better characterised by bumps instead of spikes. Both overlearning types are demonstrated in the case of artificial signals as well as magnetoencephalograms (MEG).

Model misspecification in RA arises since the homogeneity assumption fails to be satisfied in the complex real-world situation. Existing robust RAs usually resort to an augmentation of the ranking model to account for additional noises, where the collected preferences can be treated as a noisy perturbation of idealized preferences. Since the majority of robust RAs rely on certain perturbation assumptions, they cannot generalize well to agnostic noise-corrupted preferences in the real world. In this paper, we propose CoarsenRank, which possesses robustness against model misspecification. Specifically, the properties of our CoarsenRank are summarized as follows: (1) CoarsenRank is designed for mild model misspecification, which assumes there exist the ideal preferences (consistent with model assumption) that locate in a neighborhood of the actual preferences. (2) CoarsenRank then performs regular RAs over a neighborhood of the preferences instead of the original data set directly. Therefore, CoarsenRank enjoys robustness against model misspecification within a neighborhood. (3) The neighborhood of the data set is defined via their empirical data distributions. Further, we put an exponential prior on the unknown size of the neighborhood, and derive a much-simplified posterior formula for CoarsenRank under particular divergence measures. (4) CoarsenRank is further instantiated to Coarsened Thurstone, Coarsened Bradly-Terry, and Coarsened Plackett-Luce with three popular probability ranking models. Meanwhile, tractable optimization strategies are introduced with regards to each instantiation respectively. In the end, we apply CoarsenRank on four real-world data sets.

In our bounds, the trade-off between the computational cost and the learning risk convergence rate is problem specific and expressed in terms of the regularization parameter and the number of effective degrees of freedom. We study both the standard random Fourier features method for which we improve the existing bounds on the number of features required to guarantee the corresponding minimax risk convergence rate of kernel ridge regression, as well as a data-dependent modification which samples features proportional to ridge leverage scores and further reduces the required number of features. As ridge leverage scores are expensive to compute, we devise a simple approximation scheme which provably reduces the computational cost without loss of statistical efficiency.

Mode-seeking clustering assigns cluster labels by associating data samples with the nearest modes, and estimation of density ridges enables us to find lower-dimensional structures hidden in data. A key technical challenge both in mode-seeking clustering and density ridge estimation is accurate estimation of the ratios of the first- and second-order density derivatives to the density. A naive approach takes a three-step approach of first estimating the data density, then computing its derivatives, and finally taking their ratios. However, this three-step approach can be unreliable because a good density estimator does not necessarily mean a good density derivative estimator, and division by the estimated density could significantly magnify the estimation error. To cope with these problems, we propose a novel estimator for the density-derivative-ratios. The proposed estimator does not involve density estimation, but rather directly approximates the ratios of density derivatives of any order. Moreover, we establish a convergence rate of the proposed estimator.

A pertinent example is the interactions between financial assets and selected macroeconomic indicators, which has been studied at aggregate level-e.g. a stock index and an employment index-extensively in the macroeconomics literature. A key shortcoming of this approach is that it ignores potential influences from other related components (e.g. Gross Domestic Product) that may impact the system's dynamics and structure and thus produces incorrect results. To mitigate this issue, we consider a multi-block linear dynamical system with Granger-causal ordering between blocks, wherein the blocks' temporal dynamics are described by vector autoregressive processes and are influenced by blocks higher in the system hierarchy. We derive the maximum likelihood estimator for the posited model for Gaussian data in the high-dimensional setting based on appropriate regularization schemes for the parameters of the block components. To optimize the underlying non-convex likelihood function, we develop an iterative algorithm with convergence guarantees. We establish theoretical properties of the maximum likelihood estimates, leveraging the decomposability of the regularizers and a careful analysis of the iterates. Finally, we develop testing procedures for the null hypothesis of whether a block Granger-causes another block of variables.

J,"Liu, WW; Tsang, IW; Muller, KR",,,,"Liu, Weiwei; Tsang, Ivor W.; Mueller, Klaus-Robert",,,An Easy-to-hard Learning Paradigm for Multiple Classes and Multiple Labels,JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,"' Many applications, such as human action recognition and object detection, can be formulated as a multiclass classification problem. One-vs-rest (OVR) is one of the most widely used approaches for multiclass classification due to its simplicity and excellent performance. However, many confusing classes in such applications will degrade its results. For example, hand clap and boxing are two confusing actions. Hand clap is easily misclassified as boxing, and vice versa. Therefore, precisely classifying confusing classes remains a challenging task. To obtain better performance for multiclass classifications that have confusing classes, we first develop a classifier chain model for multiclass classification (CCMC) to transfer class information between classifiers. Then, based on an analysis of our proposed model, we propose an easy-to-hard learning paradigm for multiclass classification to automatically identify easy and hard classes and then use the predictions from simpler classes to help solve harder classes. Similar to CCMC, the classifier chain (CC) model is also proposed by Read et al. (2009) to capture the label dependency for multi-label classification. However, CC does not consider the order of difficulty of the labels and achieves degenerated performance when there are many confusing labels. Therefore, it is non-trivial to learn the appropriate label order for CC. Motivated by our analysis for CCMC, we also propose the easy-to-hard learning paradigm for multi-label classification to automatically identify easy and hard labels, and then use the predictions from simpler labels to help solve harder labels. We also demonstrate that our proposed strategy can be successfully applied to a wide range of applications, such as ordinal classification and relationship prediction. Extensive empirical studies validate our analysis and the effectiveness of our proposed easy-to-hard learning strategies.",,,,,"Mueller, Klaus-Robert/Y-3547-2019","Mueller, Klaus-Robert/0000-0002-3861-7685",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2017,18,,,,,,,,94,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000412484700001,0

In particular, we assume here each of the principal components v(1),...,v(r) has at most so non-zero entries. We are particularly interested in the high dimensional regime wherein p is comparable to, or even much larger than n. In an influential paper, Johnstone and Lu (2004) introduced a simple algorithm that estimates the support of the principal vectors v(1),...,v(r) by the largest entries in the diagonal of the empirical covariance. This method can be shown to identify the correct support with high probability if s(0) <= K-1 root n/log p, and to fail with high probability if s(0) >= K-2 root n/log p for two constants 0 < K-1, K-2 < infinity. Despite a considerable amount of work over the last ten years, no practical algorithm exists with provably better support recovery guarantees. Here we analyze a covariance thresholding algorithm that was recently proposed by Krauthgamer, Nadler, Vilenchik, et al. (2015). On the basis of numerical simulations (for the rank-one case), these authors conjectured that covariance thresholding correctly recover the support with high probability for s(0) <= K root n (assuming n of the same order as p). We prove this conjecture, and in fact establish a more general guarantee including higher-rank as well as n much smaller than p. Recent lower bounds (Berthet and Rigollet, 2013; Ma and Wigderson, 2015) suggest that no polynomial time algorithm can do significantly better. The key technical component of our analysis develops new bounds on the norm of kernel random matrices, in regimes that were not considered before. Using these, we also derive sharp bounds for estimating the population covariance, and the principal component (with l(2)-loss).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2016,17,,,,,,,,141,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000391660400001,0

Outliers are nominated as those clusters containing few observations. We extend an existing approach with a new merge step that reduces sensitivity to hyperparameter settings. Survey data are typically acquired under an informative sampling design where the probability of inclusion depends on the surveyed response such that the distribution for the observed sample is different from the population. We extend the derivation of a penalized objective function to use a pseudo-posterior that incorporates sampling weights that undo the informative design.

We modify this policy and derive a finite-time regret bound for the new policy, Indexed Minimum Empirical Divergence (IMED), by refining large deviation probabilities to a simple nonasymptotic form. Further, the refined analysis reveals that the finite-time regret bound is valid even in the case that the reward is not bounded from below. Therefore, our finitetime result applies to the case that the minimum reward (that is, the maximum loss) is unknown or unbounded.

In the past years, the literature has proposed measures to handle more general clusterings (e.g., fuzzy/probabilistic clusterings). This paper provides an overview of these new measures and discusses their drawbacks. We ultimately develop a corrected-for-chance measure (13AGRI) capable of comparing exclusive hard, fuzzy/probabilistic, non-exclusive hard, and possibilistic clusterings. We prove that 13AGRI and the adjusted Rand index (ARI, by Hubert and Arabie) are equivalent in the exclusive hard domain. The reported experiments show that only 13AGRI could provide both a fine-grained evaluation across clusterings with different numbers of clusters and a constant evaluation between random clusterings, showing all the four desirable properties considered here. We identified a high correlation between 13AGRI applied to fuzzy clusterings and ARI applied to hard exclusive clusterings over 14 real data sets from the UCI repository, which corroborates the validity of 13AGRI fuzzy clustering evaluation. 13AGRI also showed good results as a clustering stability statistic for solutions produced by the expectation maximization algorithm for Gaussian mixture.

The learner is allowed to sample the variable n times, but it can decide on-line which stratum to sample next. We propose an UCB-type strategy that samples the arms according to an upper bound on their estimated standard deviations. We compare its performance to an ideal sample allocation that knows the standard deviations of the arms. For sub-Gaussian arm distributions, we provide bounds on the total regret: a distribution-dependent bound of order poly(lambda(-1)(min))(O) over tilde (n(-3/2))(1) that depends on a measure of the disparity lambda(min) of the per stratum variances and a distribution-free bound poly(K)(O) over tilde (n(-7/6)) that does not.

The present paper gives a careful analysis of this hybridization approach, identifies several problems and issues with it and other previously proposed approaches, and proposes practical resolutions of those. Furthermore, simple modifications of the classical criteria for hidden path recognition are shown to lead to a new class of decoders. Dynamic programming algorithms to compute these decoders in the usual forward-backward manner are presented. A particularly interesting subclass of such estimators can be also viewed as hybrids of the MAP and PD estimators. Similar to previously proposed MAP-PD hybrids, the new class is parameterized by a small number of tunable parameters.

It is particularly useful in large scale applications like searching for an image that is similar to a given image or finding videos that are relevant to a given video. In these tasks, users look for objects that are not only visually similar but also semantically related to a given object. Unfortunately, the approaches that exist today for learning such semantic similarity do not scale to large data sets. This is both because typically their CPU and storage requirements grow quadratically with the sample size, and because many methods impose complex positivity constraints on the space of learned similarity functions. The current paper presents OASIS, an Online Algorithm for Scalable Image Similarity learning that learns a bilinear similarity measure over sparse representations. OASIS is an online dual approach using the passive-aggressive family of learning algorithms with a large margin criterion and an efficient hinge loss cost. Our experiments show that OASIS is both fast and accurate at a wide range of scales: for a data set with thousands of images, it achieves better results than existing state-of-the-art methods, while being an order of magnitude faster. For large, web scale, data sets, OASIS can be trained on more than two million images from 150K text queries within 3 days on a single CPU. On this large scale data set, human evaluations showed that 35% of the ten nearest neighbors of a given test image, as found by OASIS, were semantically relevant to that image.

One important source of complexity in belief propagation is the need to marginalize large factors to compute messages. This operation takes time exponential in the number of variables in the factor, and can limit the expressiveness of the models we can use. In this paper, we study a new class of potential functions, which we call decomposable k-way potentials, and provide efficient algorithms for computing messages from these potentials during belief propagation. We believe these new potentials provide a good balance between expressive power and efficient inference in practical structured classification problems. We discuss three instances of decomposable potentials: the associative Markov network potential, the nested junction tree, and a new type of potential which we call the voting potential. We use these potentials to classify images of protein subcellular location patterns in groups of cells. Classifying subcellular location patterns can help us answer many important questions in computational biology, including questions about how various treatments affect the synthesis and behavior of proteins and networks of proteins within a cell.

While they perform well in many categorization tasks, these methods are inherently limited when faced with more complicated tasks where external knowledge is essential. Recently, there have been efforts to augment these basic features with external knowledge, including semi-supervised learning and transfer learning. In this work, we present a new framework for automatic acquisition of world knowledge and methods for incorporating it into the text categorization process. Our approach enhances machine learning algorithms with features generated from domain-specific and common-sense knowledge. This knowledge is represented by ontologies that contain hundreds of thousands of concepts, further enriched through controlled Web crawling. Prior to text categorization, a feature generator analyzes the documents and maps them onto appropriate ontology concepts that augment the bag of words used in simple supervised learning. Feature generation is accomplished through contextual analysis of document text, thus implicitly performing word sense disambiguation. Coupled with the ability to generalize concepts using the ontology, this approach addresses two significant problems in natural language processing-synonymy and polysemy. Categorizing documents with the aid of knowledge-based features leverages information that cannot be deduced from the training documents alone.

We would like to know whether it is harder to build accurate classifiers via this approach, than by techniques that may process all data with distinct labels together. In this paper we make that question precise by considering it in the context of PAC learnability. We propose two restrictions on the PAC learning framework that are intended to correspond with the above approach, and consider their relationship with standard PAC learning. Our main restriction of interest leads to some interesting algorithms that show that the restriction is not stronger (more restrictive) than various other well-known restrictions on PAC learning. An alternative slightly milder restriction turns out to be almost equivalent to unrestricted PAC learning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,FEB,2006,7,,,,,,283,306,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000236331700004,0

This is typically done by estimating the unknown generalization errors of a set of models to be selected from and then choosing the model with minimal generalization error estimate. In this article, we discuss the problem of model selection and generalization error estimation in the context of kernel regression models, e.g., kernel ridge regression, kernel subset regression or Gaussian process regression. Previously, a non-asymptotic generalization error estimator called the subspace information criterion (SIC) was proposed, that could be successfully applied to finite dimensional subspace models. SIC is an unbiased estimator of the generalization error for the finite sample case under the conditions that the learning target function belongs to a specified reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) H and the reproducing kernels centered on training sample points span the whole space R. These conditions hold only if dim H less than or equal to l, where l (< infinity) is the number of training examples. Therefore, SIC could be applied only to finite dimensional RKHSs. In this paper, we extend the range of applicability of SIC, and show that even if the reproducing kernels centered on training sample points do not span the whole space R, SIC is an unbiased estimator of an essential part of the generalization error. Our extension allows the use of any RKHSs including infinite dimensional ones, i.e., richer function classes commonly used in Gaussian processes, support vector machines or boosting. We further show that when the kernel matrix is invertible, SIC can be expressed in a much simpler form, making its computation highly efficient. In computer simulations on ridge parameter selection with real and artificial data sets, SIC is compared favorably with other standard model selection techniques for instance leave-one-out cross-validation or an empirical Bayesian method.",,,,,"Mueller, Klaus-Robert/Y-3547-2019; Muller, Klaus R/C-3196-2013","Mueller, Klaus-Robert/0000-0002-3861-7685; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,Feb-15,2003,3,2,,,,,323,359,,10.1162/153244303765208412,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000182488500006,0

Unfortunately, there are no algorithms that provide theoretical guarantees on their ability to detect aliens under general assumptions. Further, while there are algorithms for open category detection, there are few empirical results that directly report alien detection rates. Thus, there are significant theoretical and empirical gaps in our understanding of open category detection. In this paper, we take a step toward addressing this gap by studying a simple, but practically-relevant variant of open category detection. In our setting, we are provided with a clean training set that contains only the target categories of interest and an unlabeled contaminated training set that contains a fraction alpha of alien examples. Under the assumption that we know an upper bound on alpha, we develop an algorithm that gives PAC-style guarantees on the alien detection rate, while aiming to minimize false alarms. Given an overall budget on the amount of training data, we also derive the optimal allocation of samples between the mixture and the clean data sets. Experiments on synthetic and standard benchmark datasets evaluate the regimes in which the algorithm can be effective and provide a baseline for further advancements.

This estimator minimizes a new general excess risk bound for statistical learning. On standard examples, this bound scales as d n with d the model dimension and n the sample size, and critically remains valid under model misspecification. Being an improper (out-of-model) procedure, SMP improves over within-model estimators such as the maximum likelihood estimator, whose excess risk degrades under misspecification. Compared to approaches reducing to the sequential problem, our bounds remove suboptimal log n factors and can handle unbounded classes. For the Gaussian linear model, the predictions and risk bound of SMP are governed by leverage scores of covariates, nearly matching the optimal risk in the well-specified case without conditions on the noise variance or approximation error of the linear model. For logistic regression, SMP provides a non-Bayesian approach to calibration of probabilistic predictions relying on virtual samples, and can be computed by solving two logistic regressions. It achieves a non-asymptotic excess risk of O((d+ (BR2)-R-2)/n), where R bounds the norm of features and B that of the comparison parameter; by contrast, no within-model estimator can achieve better rate than min(BR/root n, e(BR)/n) in general (Hazan et al., 2014). This provides a more practical alternative to Bayesian approaches, which require approximate posterior sampling, thereby partly addressing a question raised by Foster et al.

We study the performance of the simplest version of SGD, namely online SGD, from a random start in the setting where the parameter space is high-dimensional. We develop nearly sharp thresholds for the number of samples needed for consistent estimation as one varies the dimension. Our thresholds depend only on an intrinsic property of the population loss which we call the information exponent. In particular, our results do not assume uniform control on the loss itself, such as convexity or uniform derivative bounds. The thresholds we obtain are polynomial in the dimension and the precise exponent depends explicitly on the information exponent. As a consequence of our results, we find that except for the simplest tasks, almost all of the data is used simply in the initial search phase to obtain non-trivial correlation with the ground truth. Upon attaining non-trivial correlation, the descent is rapid and exhibits law of large numbers type behavior.

Empirical and theoretical results clearly indicate that the DNN training process itself implicitly implements a form of Self-Regularization, implicitly sculpting a more regularized energy or penalty landscape. In particular, the empirical spectral density (ESD) of DNN layer matrices displays signatures of traditionally-regularized statistical models, even in the absence of exogenously specifying traditional forms of explicit regularization, such as Dropout or Weight Norm constraints. Building on relatively recent results in RMT, most notably its extension to Universality classes of Heavy-Tailed matrices, and applying them to these empirical results, we develop a theory to identify 5+1 Phases of Training, corresponding to increasing amounts of Implicit Self-Regularization. These phases can be observed during the training process as well as in the final learned DNNs. For smaller and/or older DNNs, this Implicit Self-Regularization is like traditional Tikhonov regularization, in that there is a size scale separating signal from noise. For state-of-the-art DNNs, however, we identify a novel form of Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization, similar to the self-organization seen in the statistical physics of disordered systems (such as classical models of actual neural activity). This results from correlations arising at all size scales, which for DNNs arises implicitly due to the training process itself. This implicit Self-Regularization can depend strongly on the many knobs of the training process. In particular, we demonstrate that we can cause a small model to exhibit all 5+1 phases of training simply by changing the batch size. Our results suggest that large, well-trained DNN architectures should exhibit Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization, and we discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2021,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000687037600001,0

Here we introduce a general Empirical Bayes approach to matrix factorization (EBMF), whose key feature is that it estimates the appropriate amount of sparsity by estimating prior distributions from the observed data. The approach is very flexible: it allows for a wide range of different prior families and allows that each component of the matrix factorization may exhibit a different amount of sparsity. The key to this flexibility is the use of a variational approximation, which we show effectively reduces fitting the EBMF model to solving a simpler problem, the so-called normal means problem. We demonstrate the benefits of EBMF with sparse priors through both numerical comparisons with competing methods and through analysis of data from the GTEx (Genotype Tissue Expression) project on genetic associations across 44 human tissues.

We prove theoretically that the associated class of functions contains all Boolean functions over sets of sets of instances and we provide empirical evidence that functions of this kind can be actually learned on semi-synthetic datasets. We finally present experiments on text classification, on citation graphs, and social graph data, which show that our model obtains competitive results with respect to accuracy when compared to other approaches such as convolutional networks on graphs, while at the same time it supports a general approach to interpret the learnt model, as well as explain individual predictions.",,,,,,"TIBO, ALESSANDRO/0000-0002-9070-740X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2020,21,,,,,,,,193,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000590000600001,0

We prove estimates for the behavior of diffusion distances with respect to this time parameter under a flexible nonparametric data model, identifying a range of times in which the mesoscopic equilibria of the underlying process are revealed, corresponding to a gap between within-cluster and between-cluster diffusion distances. These structures may be missed by the top eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian, commonly used in spectral clustering.

A distinguishing feature of our algorithm is that of de-noising the data matrix via singular value thresholding, which renders our approach robust in multiple facets: it automatically identifies a good subset of donors for the synthetic control, overcomes the challenges of missing data, and continues to work well in settings where covariate information may not be provided. We posit that the setting can be viewed as an instance of the Latent Variable Model and provide the first finite sample analysis (coupled with asymptotic results) for the estimation of the counterfactual.

Many conventional policy gradient methods use Monte-Carlo techniques to estimate this gradient. The policy is improved by adjusting the parameters in the direction of the gradient estimate. Since Monte-Carlo methods tend to have high variance, a large number of samples is required to attain accurate estimates, resulting in slow convergence. In this paper, we fi rst propose a Bayesian framework for policy gradient, based on modeling the policy gradient as a Gaussian process. This reduces the number of samples needed to obtain accurate gradient estimates. Moreover, estimates of the natural gradient as well as a measure of the uncertainty in the gradient estimates, namely, the gradient covariance, are provided at little extra cost. Since the proposed Bayesian framework considers system trajectories as its basic observable unit, it does not require the dynamics within trajectories to be of any particular form, and thus, can be easily extended to partially observable problems. On the downside, it cannot take advantage of the Markov property when the system is Markovian. To address this issue, we proceed to supplement our Bayesian policy gradient framework with a new actor-critic learning model in which a Bayesian class of non-parametric critics, based on Gaussian process temporal di ff erence learning, is used. Such critics model the action-value function as a Gaussian process, allowing Bayes' rule to be used in computing the posterior distribution over action-value functions, conditioned on the observed data. Appropriate choices of the policy parameterization and of the prior covariance (kernel) between action-values allow us to obtain closed-form expressions for the posterior distribution of the gradient of the expected return with respect to the policy parameters.

We also establish the corresponding convergence rate within each region. Under general spike covariance models, the dimension (or number of variables) discourages the consistency of PCA, while the sample size and spike information (the relative size of the population eigenvalues) encourage PCA consistency.

The correction is expressed over the higher-order cumulants which are neglected by EP's local matching of moments. Through the expansion, we see that EP is correct to first order. By considering higher orders, corrections of increasing polynomial complexity can be applied to the approximation. The second order provides a correction in quadratic time, which we apply to an array of Gaussian process and Ising models.

However, due to its central importance in many applications, several approximation algorithms have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we present an analysis of three such algorithms based on convex relaxations: (i) LP-S: the linear programming (LP) relaxation proposed by Schlesinger (1976) for a special case and independently in Chekuri et al.

(2006) for a general label set. We show that the SOCP-MS and the QP-RL relaxations are equivalent. Furthermore, we prove that despite the flexibility in the form of the constraints/objective function offered by QP and SOCP, the LP-S relaxation strictly dominates (i.e., provides a better approximation than) QP-RL and SOCP-MS. We generalize these results by defining a large class of SOCP (and equivalent QP) relaxations which is dominated by the LP-S relaxation. Based on these results we propose some novel SOCP relaxations which define constraints using random variables that form cycles or cliques in the graphical model representation of the random field.

This empirical result has motivated the development of many methods that speed up reinforcement learning by modifying a task for the learner or helping the learner better generalize to novel situations. This article focuses on generalizing across tasks, thereby speeding up learning, via a novel form of transfer using handcoded task relationships.

The approximation illustrates the role of training and test sets in the performance of the algorithm. It provides a unifying approach to evaluation of various methods used in obtaining training and test sets and it takes into account the variability due to different training and test sets. For the simple problem of predicting the sample mean and in the case of smooth loss functions, we show that the variance of the CV estimator of the generalization error is a function of the moments of the random variables Y = Card(S-j boolean AND S-j') and Y* = Card(S-j(c)boolean AND S-j'(c)), where S-j, S-j' are two training sets, and S-j(c), S-j'(c) are the corresponding test sets. We prove that the distribution of Y and Y* is hypergeometric and we compare our estimator with the one proposed by Nadeau and Bengio (2003).

A first experimental observation is that the phase transition behaves as an attractor for relational learning; no matter which region the learning problem belongs to, all three learners produce hypotheses lying within or close to the phase transition region. Second, a failure region appears. All three learners fail to learn any accurate hypothesis in this region.

Given an input instance, a multiclass hypothesis computes a similarity-score between each prototype and the input instance and sets the predicted label to be the index of the prototype achieving the highest similarity. To design and analyze the learning algorithms in this paper we introduce the notion of ultraconservativeness. Ultraconservative algorithms are algorithms that update only the prototypes attaining similarity-scores which are higher than the score of the correct label's prototype. We start by describing a family of additive ultraconservative algorithms where each algorithm in the family updates its prototypes by finding a feasible solution for a set of linear constraints that depend on the instantaneous similarity-scores. We then discuss a specific online algorithm that seeks a set of prototypes which have a small norm. The resulting algorithm, which we term MIRA (for Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm) is ultraconservative as well. We derive mistake bounds for all the algorithms and provide further analysis of MIRA using a generalized notion of the margin for multiclass problems. We discuss the form the algorithms take in the binary case and show that all the algorithms from the first family reduce to the Perceptron algorithm while MIRA provides a new Perceptron-like algorithm with a margin-dependent learning rate.

Well, almost",JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) generalise remarkably well in the overparameterised regime, suggesting a strong inductive bias towards functions with low generalisation error. We empirically investigate this bias by calculating, for a range of architectures and datasets, the probability P-SGD(f vertical bar S) that an overparameterised DNN, trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or one of its variants, converges on a function f consistent with a training set S. We also use Gaussian processes to estimate the Bayesian posterior probability P-B(f vertical bar S) that the DNN expresses f upon random sampling of its parameters, conditioned on S. Our main findings are that P-SGD(f vertical bar S) correlates remarkably well with P-B(f vertical bar S) and that P-B(f vertical bar S) is strongly biased towards low-error and low complexity functions. These results imply that strong inductive bias in the parameter-function map (which determines P-B(f vertical bar S)), rather than a special property of SGD, is the primary explanation for why DNNs generalise so well in the overparameterised regime. While our results suggest that the Bayesian posterior P-B(f vertical bar S) is the first order determinant of P-SGD(f vertical bar S), there remain second order differences that are sensitive to hyperparameter tuning.

Many distributed frameworks have been proposed for different machine learning tasks. In this paper, we study the distributed kernel regression via the divide and conquer approach. The learning process consists of three stages. Firstly, the data is partitioned into multiple subsets. Then a base kernel regression algorithm is applied to each subset to learn a local regression model. Finally the local models are averaged to generate the final regression model for the purpose of predictive analytics or statistical inference. This approach has been proved asymptotically minimax optimal if the kernel is perfectly selected so that the true regression function lies in the associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space. However, this is usually, if not always, impractical because kernels that can only be selected via prior knowledge or a tuning process are hardly perfect. Instead it is more common that the kernel is good enough but imperfect in the sense that the true regression can be well approximated by but does not lie exactly in the kernel space. We show distributed kernel regression can still achieve capacity independent optimal rate in this case. To this end, we first establish a general framework that allows to analyze distributed regression with response weighted base algorithms by bounding the error of such algorithms on a single data set, provided that the error bounds have factored the impact of unexplained variance of the response variable. Then we perform a leave one out analysis of the kernel ridge regression and bias corrected kernel ridge regression, which in combination with the aforementioned framework allows us to derive sharp error bounds and capacity independent optimal rates for the associated distributed kernel regression algorithms. As a byproduct of the thorough analysis, we also prove the kernel ridge regression can achieve rates faster than O(N-1) (where N is the sample size) in the noise free setting which, to our best knowledge, are first observed and novel in regression learning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2021,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000700317400001,0

It is widely observed in existing empirical studies that when a restricted Newton step was used (as the debiasing step), the hard-thresholding algorithms tend to meet halting conditions in a significantly low number of iterations and are very efficient. Hence, the thus obtained Newton hard-thresholding algorithms call for stronger theoretical guarantees than for their simple hard-thresholding counterparts. This paper provides a theoretical justification for the use of the restricted Newton step. We build our theory and algorithm, Newton Hard-Thresholding Pursuit (NHTP), for the sparsity-constrained optimization. Our main result shows that NHTP is quadratically convergent under the standard assumption of restricted strong convexity and smoothness. We also establish its global convergence to a stationary point under a weaker assumption. In the special case of the compressive sensing, NHTP effectively reduces to some of the existing hard-thresholding algorithms with a Newton step. Consequently, our fast convergence result justifies why those algorithms perform better than without the Newton step.

Importantly, this equivalence reveals that the solution path can be viewed as the flow of a hybrid of gradient descent and Newton method applying to the empirical loss, which is similar to a widely used optimization technique called trust region method. This provides an interesting algorithmic view of l(2) regularization, and is in contrast to the conventional view that the l(2) regularization solution path is similar to the gradient flow of the empirical loss. New path-following algorithms based on homotopy methods and numerical ODE solvers are proposed to numerically approximate the solution path. In particular, we consider respectively Newton method and gradient descent method as the basis algorithm for the homotopy method, and establish their approximation error rates over the solution path. Importantly, our theory suggests novel schemes to choose grid points that guarantee an arbitrarily small suboptimality for the solution path. In terms of computational cost, we prove that in order to achieve an f-suboptimality for the entire solution path, the number of Newton steps required for the Newton method is O(f(-1/2)), while the number of gradient steps required for the gradient descent method is O (f(-1)ln(f(-1))).

The test imposes a Renyi mutual information cost constraint which impacts how the agent can select attention strategies to maximize their expected utility.

A basic instance of this trade-off is the problem of deciding when to make noisy and costly observations of a discrete-time Gaussian random walk, so as to minimise the posterior variance plus observation costs. We present the first proof that a simple policy, which observes when the posterior variance exceeds a threshold, is optimal for this problem. The proof generalises to a wide range of cost functions other than the posterior variance. It is based on a new verification theorem by Nifio-Mora that guarantees threshold structure for Markov decision processes, and on the relation between binary sequences known as Christoffel words and the dynamics of discontinuous nonlinear maps, which frequently arise in physics, control and biology. This result implies that optimal policies for linear-quadratic-Gaussian control with costly observations have a threshold structure. It also implies that the restless bandit problem of observing multiple such time series, has a well-defined Whittle index policy. We discuss computation of that index, give closed-form formulae for it, and compare the performance of the associated index policy with heuristic policies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2019,20,,,,,,,,35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000463318300001,0

However, a number of challenges arises in learning large-scale DAG models including model identifiability and computational complexity since the space of directed graphs is huge. In this paper, we address these issues in a number of steps for a broad class of DAG models where the noise or variance is signal-dependent. Firstly we introduce a new class of identifiable DAG models, where each node has a distribution where the variance is a quadratic function of the mean (QVF DAG models). Our QVF DAG models include many interesting classes of distributions such as Poisson, Binomial, Geometric, Exponential, Gamma and many other distributions in which the noise variance depends on the mean. We prove that this class of QVF DAG models is identifiable, and introduce a new algorithm, the OverDispersion Scoring (ODS) algorithm, for learning large-scale QVF DAG models. Our algorithm is based on firstly learning the moralized or undirected graphical model representation of the DAG to reduce the DAG search-space, and then exploiting the quadratic variance property to learn the ordering. We show through theoretical results and simulations that our algorithm is statistically consistent in the high-dimensional p > n setting provided that the degree of the moralized graph is bounded and performs well compared to state-of-the-art DAG-learning algorithms.

It was also shown in (Dasgupta, 2016) that a top-down algorithm based on the uniform Sparsest Cut problem returns a hierarchical clustering of cost at most O (alpha(n) log n) times the cost of the optimal hierarchical clustering, where a n is the approximation ratio of the Sparsest Cut subroutine used. Thus using the best known approximation algorithm for Sparsest Cut due to Arora-Rao-Vazirani, the top-down algorithm returns a hierarchical clustering of cost at most O (log(3/2) n) times the cost of the optimal solution. We improve this by giving an O (log n) -approximation algorithm for this problem. Our main technical ingredients are a combinatorial characterization of ultrametrics induced by this cost function, deriving an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation for this family of ultrametrics, and showing how to iteratively round an LP relaxation of this formulation by using the idea of sphere growing which has been extensively used in the context of graph partitioning. We also prove that our algorithm returns an O (log n) -approximate hierarchical clustering for a generalization of this cost function also studied in (Dasgupta, 2016). Experiments show that the hierarchies found by using the ILP formulation as well as our rounding algorithm often have better projections into flat clusters than the standard linkage based algorithms.

We show that our algorithm achieves the optimal convergence rate up to a logarithmic factor. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets.

Most approaches build up interaction sets incrementally, adding variables in a greedy fashion. The drawback is that potentially informative high-order interactions may be overlooked. Here, we propose an alternative approach for classification problems with binary predictor variables, called Random Intersection Trees. It works by starting with a maximal interaction that includes all variables, and then gradually removing variables if they fail to appear in randomly chosen observations of a class of interest. We show that informative interactions are retained with high probability, and the computational complexity of our procedure is of order p(kappa), where p is the number of predictor variables. The value of kappa can reach values as low as 1 for very sparse data; in many more general settings, it will still beat the exponent s obtained when using a brute force search constrained to order s interactions. In addition, by using some new ideas based on min-wise hash schemes, we are able to further reduce the computational cost.

The undirected graphical model selection (UGMS) problem is to estimate the graph G* given observations drawn from the undirected graphical model. This paper proposes a framework for decomposing the UGMS problem into multiple subproblems over clusters and subsets of the separators in a junction tree. The junction tree is constructed using a graph that contains a superset of the edges in G*. We highlight three main properties of using junction trees for UGMS. First, different regularization parameters or different UGMS algorithms can be used to learn different parts of the graph. This is possible since the subproblems we identify can be solved independently of each other. Second, under certain conditions, a junction tree based UGMS algorithm can produce consistent results with fewer observations than the usual requirements of existing algorithms. Third, both our theoretical and experimental results show that the junction tree framework does a significantly better job at finding the weakest edges in a graph than existing methods. This property is a consequence of both the first and second properties. Finally, we note that our framework is independent of the choice of the UGMS algorithm and can be used as a wrapper around standard UGMS algorithms for more accurate graph estimation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,JAN,2014,15,,,,,,147,191,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000335457400005,0

Logistic regression and Support Vector Machines are typical examples of soft and hard classifiers respectively. The essential difference between these two groups is whether one needs to estimate the class conditional probability for the classification task or not. In particular, soft classifiers predict the label based on the obtained class conditional probabilities, while hard classifiers bypass the estimation of probabilities and focus on the decision boundary. In practice, for the goal of accurate classification, it is unclear which one to use in a given situation. To tackle this problem, the Large-margin Unified Machine (LUM) was recently proposed as a unified family to embrace both groups. The LUM family enables one to study the behavior change from soft to hard binary classifiers. For multicategory cases, however, the concept of soft and hard classification becomes less clear. In that case, class probability estimation becomes more involved as it requires estimation of a probability vector. In this paper, we propose a new Multicategory LUM (MLUM) framework to investigate the behavior of soft versus hard classification under multicategory settings.

Hyam",,,A Geometric Approach to Sample Compression,JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Sample Compression Conjecture of Littlestone & Warmuth has remained unsolved for a quarter century. While maximum classes (concept classes meeting Sauer's Lemma with equality) can be compressed, the compression of general concept classes reduces to compressing maximal classes (classes that cannot be expanded without increasing VC dimension). Two promising ways forward are: embedding maximal classes into maximum classes with at most a polynomial increase to VC dimension, and compression via operating on geometric representations. This paper presents positive results on the latter approach and a first negative result on the former, through a systematic investigation of finite maximum classes. Simple arrangements of hyperplanes in hyperbolic space are shown to represent maximum classes, generalizing the corresponding Euclidean result. We show that sweeping a generic hyperplane across such arrangements forms an unlabeled compression scheme of size VC dimension and corresponds to a special case of peeling the one-inclusion graph, resolving a recent conjecture of Kuzmin & Warmuth. A bijection between finite maximum classes and certain arrangements of piecewise-linear (PL) hyperplanes in either a ball or Euclidean space is established. Finally we show that d-maximum classes corresponding to PL-hyperplane arrangements in R-d have cubical complexes homeomorphic to a d-ball, or equivalently complexes that are manifolds with boundary. A main result is that PL arrangements can be swept by a moving hyperplane to unlabeled d-compress any finite maximum class, forming a peeling scheme as conjectured by Kuzmin & Warmuth. A corollary is that some d-maximal classes cannot be embedded into any maximum class of VC-dimension d + k, for any constant k. The construction of the PL sweeping involves Pachner moves on the one-inclusion graph, corresponding to moves of a hyperplane across the intersection of d other hyperplanes. This extends the well known Pachner moves for triangulations to cubical complexes.",,,,,,"Rubinstein, Joachim/0000-0002-5712-0113",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,APR,2012,13,,,,,,1221,1261,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000303773100011,0

This article corrects these weaknesses by measuring margin not in the absolute sense but rather only relative to the spread of data in any projection direction. Maximum relative margin corresponds to a data-dependent regularization on the classification function while maximum absolute margin corresponds to an l(2) norm constraint on the classification function. Interestingly, the proposed improvements only require simple extensions to existing maximum margin formulations and preserve the computational efficiency of SVMs. Through the maximization of relative margin, surprising performance gains are achieved on real-world problems such as digit, text classification and on several other benchmark data sets.

However, such causal diagrams are seldom fully testable given observational data. In consequence, many causal discovery algorithms based on data-mining can only output an equivalence class of causal diagrams ( rather than a single one).

We consider the alternative of varying the asymmetry of the cost function used for training. We show that the ROC curve obtained by varying both the intercept and the asymmetry, and hence the slope, always outperforms the ROC curve obtained by varying only the intercept.

The neural networks are usually trained by tuning the weights to directly minimise a given loss function. In this paper we propose to re-parameterise the weights into targets for the firing strengths of the individual nodes in the network. Given a set of targets, it is possible to calculate the weights which make the firing strengths best meet those targets. It is argued that using targets for training addresses the problem of exploding gradients, by a process which we call cascade untangling, and makes the loss-function surface smoother to traverse, and so leads to easier, faster training, and also potentially better generalisation, of the neural network. It also allows for easier learning of deeper and recurrent network structures. The necessary conversion of targets to weights comes at an extra computational expense, which is in many cases manageable. Learning in target space can be combined with existing neural-network optimisers, for extra gain.

This model produces community structure in the network that exhibits change at a single time epoch. We propose two methods of estimating the change point, together with the model parameters, before and after its occurrence. The first employs a least-squares criterion function and takes into consideration the full structure of the stochastic block model and is evaluated at each point in time. Hence, as an intermediate step, it requires estimating the community structure based on a clustering algorithm at every time point. The second method comprises the following two steps: in the first one, a least-squares function is used and evaluated at each time point, but ignoring the community structure and only considering a random graph generating mechanism exhibiting a change point. Once the change point is identified, in the second step, all network data before and after it are used together with a clustering algorithm to obtain the corresponding community structures and subsequently estimate the generating stochastic block model parameters. The first method, since it requires knowledge of the community structure and hence clustering at every point in time, is significantly more computationally expensive than the second one. On the other hand, it requires a significantly less stringent identifiability condition for consistent estimation of the change point and the model parameters than the second method; however, it also requires a condition on the misclassification rate of misallocating network nodes to their respective communities that may fail to hold in many realistic settings. Despite the apparent stringency of the identifiability condition for the second method, we show that networks generated by a stochastic block mechanism exhibiting a change in their structure can easily satisfy this condition under a multitude of scenarios, including merging/splitting communities, nodes joining another community, etc. Further, for both methods under their respective identifiability and certain additional regularity conditions, we establish rates of convergence and derive the asymptotic distributions of the change point estimators. The results are illustrated on synthetic data. In summary, this work provides an in-depth investigation of the novel problem of change point analysis for networks generated by stochastic block models, identifies key conditions for the consistent estimation of the change point, and proposes a computationally fast algorithm that solves the problem in many settings that occur in applications.

This distinct feature strikes a balance between a parametric model and a fully nonparametric model, which makes the proposed model attractive for handling large networks. We develop an estimator for AFDAG based on a linear operator that characterizes ACI, and establish the consistency and convergence rates of this estimator, as well as the uniform consistency of the estimated DAG. Moreover, we introduce a modified PC-algorithm to implement the estimating procedure efficiently, so that its complexity is determined by the level of sparseness rather than the dimension of the network. Through simulation studies we show that our method outperforms existing methods when commonly assumed conditions such as Gaussian or Gaussian copula distributions do not hold.

Then, we train over 14 000 models covering most prominent methods and evaluation metrics in a reproducible large-scale experimental study on eight data sets. We observe that while the different methods successfully enforce properties encouraged by the corresponding losses, well-disentangled models seemingly cannot be identified without supervision. Furthermore, different evaluation metrics do not always agree on what should be considered disentangled and exhibit systematic differences in the estimation. Finally, increased disentanglement does not seem to necessarily lead to a decreased sample complexity of learning for downstream tasks.

To mitigate this, techniques known as screening rules and working sets diminish the size of the optimization problem at hand, either by progressively removing variables, or by solving a growing sequence of smaller problems. For both techniques, significant variables are identified thanks to convex duality arguments. In this paper, we show that the dual iterates of a GLM exhibit a Vector AutoRegressive (VAR) behavior after sign identification, when the primal problem is solved with proximal gradient descent or cyclic coordinate descent.

Topic models provide two forms of output. The first is a predictive model. This type of model has the ability to predict unseen documents (e.g., their categories). When topic models are used in this way, there are ample measures to assess their performance. The second output of these models is the topics themselves. Topics are lists of keywords that describe the top words pertaining to each topic. Often, these lists of keywords are presented to a human subject who then assesses the meaning of the topic, which is ultimately subjective. One of the fundamental problems of topic models lies in assessing the quality of the topics from the perspective of human interpretability. Naturally, human subjects need to be employed to evaluate interpretability of a topic. Lately, crowdsourcing approaches are widely used to serve the role of human subjects in evaluation. In this work we study measures of interpretability and propose to measure topic interpretability from two perspectives: topic coherence and topic consensus. We start with an existing measure for topic coherence model precision. It evaluates coherence of a topic by introducing an intruded word and measuring how well a human subject or a crowdsourcing approach could identify the intruded word: if it is easy to identify, the topic is coherent. We then investigate how we can measure coherence comprehensively by examining dimensions of topic coherence. For the second perspective of topic interpretability, we suggest topic consensus that measures how well the results of a crowdsourcing approach matches those given categories of topics. Good topics should lead to good categories, thus, high topic consensus. Therefore, if there is low topic consensus in terms of categories, topics could be of low interpretability. We then further discuss how topic coherence and topic consensus assess different aspects of topic interpretability and hope that this work can pave way for comprehensive measures of topic interpretability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2018,18,,,,,,,,169,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000435441200001,0

We demonstrate that the proposed data sparsity method can have competitive prediction performance for certain situations, and have comparable performance in other cases compared to that of the traditional squared norm penalty. Therefore, the data sparsity method can serve as a competitive alternative to the squared norm penalty method. Some theoretical properties of our proposed method using the data sparsity constraint are obtained. Both simulated and real data sets are used to demonstrate the usefulness of our data sparsity constraint.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2016,17,,,,,,,,40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000391482600001,0

In 1744 Euler introduced the elastica energy for a 2D curve on modeling torsion-free thin elastic rods. Together with its degenerate form of total variation (TV), Euler's elastica has been successfully applied to low-dimensional data processing such as image denoising and image inpainting in the last two decades. Our motivation is to apply Euler's elastica to high-dimensional supervised learning problems. To this end, a supervised learning problem is modeled as an energy functional minimization under a new geometric regularization scheme, where the energy is composed of a squared loss and an elastica penalty. The elastica penalty aims at regularizing the approximated function by heavily penalizing large gradients and high curvature values on all level curves. We take a computational PDE approach to minimize the energy functional. By using variational principles, the energy minimization problem is transformed into an Euler-Lagrange PDE. However, this PDE is usually high-dimensional and can not be directly handled by common low-dimensional solvers. To circumvent this difficulty, we use radial basis functions (RBF) to approximate the target function, which reduces the optimization problem to finding the linear coefficients of these basis functions. Some theoretical properties of this new model, including the existence and uniqueness of solutions and universal consistency, are analyzed. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model for binary classification, multi-class classification, and regression tasks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,DEC,2015,16,,,,,,3637,3686,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000369888000040,0

For example, by using the empirical statistical leverage scores as an importance sampling distribution, the method of algorithmic leveraging samples and rescales rows/columns of data matrices to reduce the data size before performing computations on the subproblem. This method has been successful in improving computational efficiency of algorithms for matrix problems such as least-squares approximation, least absolute deviations approximation, and low-rank matrix approximation. Existing work has focused on algorithmic issues such as worst-case running times and numerical issues associated with providing high-quality implementations, but none of it addresses statistical aspects of this method. In this paper, we provide a simple yet effective framework to evaluate the statistical properties of algorithmic leveraging in the context of estimating parameters in a linear regression model with a fixed number of predictors. In particular, for several versions of leverage-based sampling, we derive results for the bias and variance, both conditional and unconditional on the observed data. We show that from the statistical perspective of bias and variance, neither leverage-based sampling nor uniform sampling dominates the other. This result is particularly striking, given the well-known result that, from the algorithmic perspective of worst-case analysis, leverage-based sampling provides uniformly superior worst-case algorithmic results, when compared with uniform sampling. Based on these theoretical results, we propose and analyze two new leveraging algorithms: one constructs a smaller least-squares problem with shrinkage leverage scores (SLEV), and the other solves a smaller and unweighted (or biased) least-squares problem (LEVUNW). A detailed empirical evaluation of existing leverage-based methods as well as these two new methods is carried out on both synthetic and real data sets. The empirical results indicate that our theory is a good predictor of practical performance of existing and new leverage-based algorithms and that the new algorithms achieve improved performance. For example, with the same computation reduction as in the original algorithmic leveraging approach, our proposed SLEV typically leads to improved biases and variances both unconditionally and conditionally (on the observed data), and our proposed LEVUNW typically yields improved unconditional biases and variances.",,,,,"Ma, Ping/M-7746-2015","Ma, Ping/0000-0002-5728-3596",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,APR,2015,16,,,,,,861,911,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000369886300007,0

The literature includes numerous applications where harmonic functions provided estimates that conformed to data satisfying this well-known assumption, but the relationship between this assumption and harmonic functions is not as well-understood theoretically. We investigate these matters from the perspective of supervised kernel classification and provide concrete answers to two fundamental questions. (i) Under what conditions do semi-supervised harmonic approaches satisfy this assumption? (ii) If such an assumption is satisfied then why precisely would an observation sacrifice its own supervised estimate in favor of the cluster? First, a harmonic function is guaranteed to assign labels to data in harmony with the cluster assumption if a specific condition on the boundary of the harmonic function is satisfied. Second, it is shown that any harmonic function estimate within the interior is a probability weighted average of supervised estimates, where the weight is focused on supervised kernel estimates near labeled cases. We demonstrate that the uniqueness criterion for harmonic estimators is sensitive when the graph is sparse or the size of the boundary is relatively small. This sets the stage for a third contribution, a new regularized joint harmonic function for semi-supervised learning based on a joint optimization criterion. Mathematical properties of this estimator, such as its uniqueness even when the graph is sparse or the size of the boundary is relatively small, are proven. A main selling point is its ability to operate in circumstances where the cluster assumption may not be fully satisfied on real data by compromising between the purely harmonic and purely supervised estimators.

We show that this algorithm can learn an unknown gamma-margin halfspace over n dimensions using n . poly(1/gamma) processors and running in time (O) over tilde (1/gamma) + O(log n). In contrast, naive parallel algorithms that learn a gamma-margin halfspace in time that depends polylogarithmically on n have an inverse quadratic running time dependence on the margin parameter gamma. Our negative result deals with boosting, which is a standard approach to learning large-margin halfspaces. We prove that in the original PAC framework, in which a weak learning algorithm is provided as an oracle that is called by the booster, boosting cannot be parallelized. More precisely, we show that, if the algorithm is allowed to call the weak learner multiple times in parallel within a single boosting stage, this ability does not reduce the overall number of successive stages of boosting needed for learning by even a single stage.

Motivated by the impressive convergence rate of CPM on a number of practical problems, it was conjectured that these rates can be further improved.

Computationally, our smoothing technique is also particularly advantageous for optimizing multivariate performance scores such as precision/recall break-even point and ROCArea; the cost per iteration remains the same as that of CPMs. Empirical evaluation on some of the largest publicly available data sets shows that our method converges significantly faster than CPMs without sacrificing generalization ability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,DEC,2012,13,,,,,,3623,3680,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000314529000007,0

In our approach, the metric is trained with the goal that the k-nearest neighbors always belong to the same class while examples from different classes are separated by a large margin. As in support vector machines (SVMs), the margin criterion leads to a convex optimization based on the hinge loss. Unlike learning in SVMs, however, our approach requires no modification or extension for problems in multiway (as opposed to binary) classification. In our framework, the Mahalanobis distance metric is obtained as the solution to a semidefinite program.

A key component of our approach is the development of approximate triangle inequalities for expected loss, which may be of independent interest. We discuss the related problem of learning parameters of a distribution from multiple data sources.

The proposed algorithms unify centroid-based parametric clustering approaches, such as classical kmeans, the Linde-Buzo-Gray (LBG) algorithm and information-theoretic clustering, which arise by special choices of the Bregman divergence. The algorithms maintain the simplicity and scalability of the classical kmeans algorithm, while generalizing the method to a large class of clustering loss functions. This is achieved by first posing the hard clustering problem in terms of minimizing the loss in Bregman information, a quantity motivated by rate distortion theory, and then deriving an iterative algorithm that monotonically decreases this loss. In addition, we show that there is a bijection between regular exponential families and a large class of Bregman divergences, that we call regular Bregman divergences. This result enables the development of an alternative interpretation of an efficient EM scheme for learning mixtures of exponential family distributions, and leads to a simple soft clustering algorithm for regular Bregman divergences.

Explicit error bounds are derived to show that the size of the FNO, approximating operators associated with a Darcy type elliptic PDE and with the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations of fluid dynamics, only increases sub (log)-linearly in terms of the reciprocal of the error.

Due to the imminent need to alleviate the communication burden, the investigation of communicationefficient distributed optimization algorithms - particularly for empirical risk minimization - has flourished in recent years. A large fraction of these algorithms have been developed for the master/slave setting, relying on the presence of a central parameter server that can communicate with all agents. This paper focuses on distributed optimization over networks, or decentralized optimization, where each agent is only allowed to aggregate information from its neighbors over a network (namely, no centralized coordination is present). By properly adjusting the global gradient estimate via local averaging in conjunction with proper correction, we develop a communication-efficient approximate Newton-type method, called Network-DANE, which generalizes DANE to accommodate decentralized scenarios. Our key ideas can be applied, in a systematic manner, to obtain decentralized versions of other master/slave distributed algorithms. A notable development is Network-SVRG/SARAH, which employs variance reduction at each agent to further accelerate local computation. We establish linear convergence of Network-DANE and Network-SVRG for strongly convex losses, and Network-SARAH for quadratic losses, which shed light on the impacts of data homogeneity, network connectivity, and local averaging upon the rate of convergence. We further extend Network-DANE to composite optimization by allowing a nonsmooth penalty term.

While different approaches to address this problem have been proposed, either in the context of kernel-based learning, or via carefully designed vectorization techniques, it remains an open problem how to leverage advances in representation learning via deep neural networks. Appropriately handling topological summaries as input to neural networks would address the disadvantage of previous strategies which handle this type of data in a task-agnostic manner. In particular, we propose an approach that is designed to learn a task-specific representation of barcodes. In other words, we aim to learn a representation that adapts to the learning problem while, at the same time, preserving theoretical properties (such as stability). This is done by projecting barcodes into a finite dimensional vector space using a collection of parametrized functionals, so called structure elements, for which we provide a generic construction scheme. A theoretical analysis of this approach reveals sufficient conditions to preserve stability, and also shows that different choices of structure elements lead to great differences with respect to their suitability for numerical optimization.

It is usually assumed that the probability that item i is preferred over item j is p(ij) = F(mu(i) - mu(j)) where F is a symmetric distribution function, which we refer to as the comparison function, and mu(i) and mu(j) are the merits or scores of the compared items. This modelling framework, which is ubiquitous in the paired comparison literature, strongly depends on the assumption that the comparison function F is known. In practice, however, this assumption is often unrealistic and may result in poor fit and erroneous inferences. This limitation has motivated us to relax the assumption that F is fully known and simultaneously estimate the merits of the objects and the underlying comparison function. Our formulation yields a flexible semi-definite programming problem that we use as a refinement step for estimating the paired comparison probability matrix. We provide a detailed sensitivity analysis and, as a result, we establish the consistency of the resulting estimators and provide bounds on the estimation and approximation errors. Some statistical properties of the resulting estimators as well as model selection criteria are investigated.

Motivated by the common practice of using plug-in estimates eta((G) over cap) as proxies for eta(G), our focus is on the problem of characterizing the distribution of the discrepancy D = eta((G) over cap) eta(G), in the case where eta(center dot) is a subgraph count. Specifically, we study the fundamental case where the statistic of interest is vertical bar E vertical bar, the number of edges in G. Our primary contribution in this paper is to show that in the empirically relevant setting of large graphs with low-rate measurement errors, the distribution of D-E = vertical bar(E) over cap vertical bar - vertical bar E vertical bar is well-characterized by a Skellam distribution, when the errors are independent or weakly dependent. Under an assumption of independent errors, we are able to further show conditions under which this characterization is strictly better than that of an appropriate normal distribution. These results derive from our formulation of a general result, quantifying the accuracy with which the difference of two sums of dependent Bernoulli random variables may be approximated by the difference of two independent Poisson random variables, i.e., by a Skellam distribution. This general result is developed through the use of Stein's method, and may be of some general interest.

One of the most important problems in this field is to answer queries while preserving differential privacy. In spite of extensive studies, most existing work on differentially private query answering assumes the data are discrete (i.e., in {0, 1}(d)) and focuses on queries induced by Boolean functions. In real applications however, continuous data are at least as common as binary data. Thus, in this work we explore a less studied topic, namely, differential privately query answering for continuous data with continuous function. As a first step towards the continuous case, we study a natural class of linear queries on continuous data which we refer to as smooth queries. A linear query is said to be K-smooth if it is specified by a function de fined on [1; 1](d) whose partial derivatives up to order K are all bounded. We develop two is an element of-differentially private mechanisms which are able to answer all smooth queries. The first mechanism outputs a summary of the database and can then give answers to the queries. The second mechanism is an improvement of the first one and it outputs a synthetic database. The two mechanisms both achieve an accuracy of O(n-K/2d+K/is an element of). Here we assume that the dimension d is a constant. It turns out that even in this parameter setting (which is almost trivial in the discrete case), using existing discrete mechanisms to answer the smooth queries is difficult and requires more noise.

In this model, there is an oracle, called the Teacher, that can answer membership and equivalence queries posed by the Learner. Motivated by this feature, we first characterise the complexity of the equivalence problem for multiplicity tree automata, showing that it is logspace equivalent to polynomial identity testing. We then move to query complexity, deriving lower bounds on the number of queries needed to learn multiplicity tree automata over both fixed and arbitrary fields. In the latter case, the bound is linear in the size of the target automaton. The best known upper bound on the query complexity over arbitrary fields derives from an algorithm of Habrard and Oncina (2006), in which the number of queries is proportional to the size of the target automaton and the size of a largest counterexample, represented as a tree, that is returned by the Teacher. However, a smallest counterexample tree may already be exponential in the size of the target automaton. Thus the above algorithm has query complexity exponentially larger than our lower bound, and does not run in time polynomial in the size of the target automaton. We give a new learning algorithm for multiplicity tree automata in which counterexamples to equivalence queries are represented as DAGs. The query complexity of this algorithm is quadratic in the target automaton size and linear in the size of a largest counterexample. In particular, if the Teacher always returns DAG counterexamples of minimal size then the query complexity is quadratic in the target automaton size-almost matching the lower bound, and improving the best previously-known algorithm by an exponential factor.",,,,,,"Worrell, James/0000-0001-8151-2443",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,DEC,2015,16,,,,,,2465,2500,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000369888000005,0

We show that under reasonable assumptions on the intervention experiments, interventional Markov equivalence defines a finer partitioning of DAGs than observational Markov equivalence and hence improves the identifiability of causal models. We give a graph theoretic criterion for two DAGs being Markov equivalent under interventions and show that each interventional Markov equivalence class can, analogously to the observational case, be uniquely represented by a chain graph called interventional essential graph ( also known as CPDAG in the observational case).

In this paper, we take advantage of the fact that many models have maximal cliques that are larger than their constituent factors, and also of the fact that many factors consist only of latent variables (i.e., they do not depend on an observation).

Many popular applications of blind source separation are based on linear instantaneous mixture models. If specific invariance properties are known about the sources, for example, translation or rotation invariance, the simple linear model can be extended by inclusion of the corresponding transformations. When the sources are invariant against translations (spatial displacements or time shifts) the resulting model is called an anechoic mixing model. We present a new algorithmic framework for the solution of anechoic problems in arbitrary dimensions. This framework is derived from stochastic time-frequency analysis in general, and the marginal properties of the Wigner-Ville spectrum in particular. The method reduces the general anechoic problem to a set of anechoic problems with non-negativity constraints and a phase retrieval problem. The first type of subproblem can be solved by existing algorithms, for example by an appropriate modification of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF).

The performance of these methods improves when relations among the local frequency coefficients are explicitly included. However, in these techniques, analytical estimates can be obtained only for particular combinations of analytical models of signal and noise, thus precluding its straightforward extension to deal with other arbitrary noise sources. In this paper, we propose an alternative non-explicit way to take into account the relations among natural image wavelet coefficients for denoising: we use support vector regression (SVR) in the wavelet domain to enforce these relations in the estimated signal. Since relations among the coefficients are specific to the signal, the regularization property of SVR is exploited to remove the noise, which does not share this feature. The specific signal relations are encoded in an anisotropic kernel obtained from mutual information measures computed on a representative image database. In the proposed scheme, training considers minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between the estimated and actual probability functions (or histograms) of signal and noise in order to enforce similarity up to the higher (computationally estimable) order. Due to its non-parametric nature, the method can eventually cope with different noise sources without the need of an explicit re-formulation, as it is strictly necessary under parametric Bayesian formalisms. Results under several noise levels and noise sources show that: (1) the proposed method outperforms conventional wavelet methods that assume coefficient independence, (2) it is similar to state-of-the-art methods that do explicitly include these relations when the noise source is Gaussian, and (3) it gives better numerical and visual performance when more complex, realistic noise sources are considered.

Linear function approximation is used by the critic in order estimate the value function, and the temporal difference signal, which is passed from the critic to the actor. The main distinguishing feature of the present convergence proof is that both the actor and the critic operate on a similar time scale, while in most current convergence proofs they are required to have very different time scales in order to converge. Moreover, the same temporal difference signal is used to update the parameters of both the actor and the critic.

Therefore its unique advantages such as dual sparseness and kernel tricks cannot be easily conjoined with the merits of a probabilistic model such as Bayesian regularization, model averaging, and ability to model hidden variables. In this paper, we present a new general framework called maximum entropy discrimination Markov networks (MaxEnDNet, or simply, MEDN), which integrates these two approaches and combines and extends their merits. Major innovations of this approach include: 1) It extends the conventional max-entropy discrimination learning of classification rules to a new structural max-entropy discrimination paradigm of learning a distribution of Markov networks. 2) It generalizes the extant Markov network structured-prediction rule based on a point estimator of model coefficients to an averaging model akin to a Bayesian predictor that integrates over a learned posterior distribution of model coefficients. 3) It admits flexible entropic regularization of the model during learning. By plugging in different prior distributions of the model coefficients, it subsumes the well-known maximum margin Markov networks ((MN)-N-3) as a special case, and leads to a model similar to an L-1-regularized (MN)-N-3 that is simultaneously primal and dual sparse, or other new types of Markov networks. 4) It applies a modular learning algorithm that combines existing variational inference techniques and convex-optimization based (MN)-N-3 solvers as subroutines. Essentially, MEDN can be understood as a jointly maximum likelihood and maximum margin estimate of Markov network. It represents the first successful attempt to combine maximum entropy learning (a dual form of maximum likelihood learning) with maximum margin learning of Markov network for structured input/output problems; and the basic principle can be generalized to learning arbitrary graphical models, such as the generative Bayesian networks or models with structured hidden variables.

We show that under a certain irrepresentable condition on the design matrix (but independent of the sparse target), the greedy algorithm can select features consistently when the sample size approaches infinity. The condition is identical to a corresponding condition for Lasso. Moreover, under a sparse eigenvalue condition, the greedy algorithm can reliably identify features as long as each nonzero coefficient is larger than a constant times the noise level. In comparison, Lasso may require the coefficients to be larger than O(root s) times the noise level in the worst case, where s is the number of nonzero coefficients.",,,,,"Zhang, Tong/HGC-1090-2022",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,MAR,2009,10,,,,,,555,568,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000270824500001,0

We propose a completely data-driven calibration algorithm for these parameters in the least-squares regression framework, without assuming a particular shape for the penalty. Our algorithm relies on the concept of minimal penalty, recently introduced by Birge and Massart (2007) in the context of penalized least squares for Gaussian homoscedastic regression. On the positive side, the minimal penalty can be evaluated from the data themselves, leading to a data-driven estimation of an optimal penalty which can be used in practice; on the negative side, their approach heavily relies on the homoscedastic Gaussian nature of their stochastic framework. The purpose of this paper is twofold: stating a more general heuristics for designing a data-driven penalty (the slope heuristics) and proving that it works for penalized least-squares regression with a random design, even for heteroscedastic non-Gaussian data. For technical reasons, some exact mathematical results will be proved only for regressogram bin-width selection.

Here, instead of trying to directly determine which features are better, we attempt to learn the properties of good features. For this purpose we assume that each feature is represented by a set of properties, referred to as meta-features. This approach enables prediction of the quality of features without measuring their value on the training instances. We use this ability to devise new selection algorithms that can efficiently search for new good features in the presence of a huge number of features, and to dramatically reduce the number of feature measurements needed. We demonstrate our algorithms on a handwritten digit recognition problem and a visual object category recognition problem. In addition, we show how this novel viewpoint enables derivation of better generalization bounds for the joint learning problem of selection and classification, and how it contributes to a better understanding of the problem. Specifically, in the context of object recognition, previous works showed that it is possible to find one set of features which fits most object categories (aka a universal dictionary).

We gathered 1; 971 benign and 1; 651 malicious executables and encoded each as a training example using n-grams of byte codes as features. Such processing resulted in more than 255 million distinct n-grams. After selecting the most relevant n-grams for prediction, we evaluated a variety of inductive methods, including naive Bayes, decision trees, support vector machines, and boosting. Ultimately, boosted decision trees outperformed other methods with an area under the ROC curve of 0.996. Results suggest that our methodology will scale to larger collections of executables. We also evaluated how well the methods classified executables based on the function of their payload, such as opening a backdoor and mass-mailing. Areas under the ROC curve for detecting payload function were in the neighborhood of 0.9, which were smaller than those for the detection task. However, we attribute this drop in performance to fewer training examples and to the challenge of obtaining properly labeled examples, rather than to a failing of the methodology or to some inherent difficulty of the classification task. Finally, we applied detectors to 291 malicious executables discovered after we gathered our original collection, and boosted decision trees achieved a true-positive rate of 0.98 for a desired false-positive rate of 0.05.

However, computing an optimal policy for this fully observed model, and so for the original POMDP, using classical dynamic or linear programming methods is challenging even if the original system has finite state and action spaces, since the state space of the fully observed belief-MDP model is always uncountable. Furthermore, there exist very few rigorous value function approximation and optimal policy approximation results, as regularity conditions needed often require a tedious study involving the spaces of probability measures leading to properties such as Feller continuity. In this paper, we study a planning problem for POMDPs where the system dynamics and measurement channel model are assumed to be known.

Noise filtering, aiming to detect and remove polluted samples, is one of the main ways to deal with the noise on outputs. However, most of the filters are heuristic and could not explain the filtering influence on the generalization error (GE) bound. The hyper-parameters in various filters are specified manually or empirically, and they are usually unable to adapt to the data environment. The filter with an improper hyper-parameter may overclean, leading to a weak generalization ability. This paper proposes a unified framework of optimal sample selection (OSS) for the output noise filtering from the perspective of error bound. The covering distance filter (CDF) under the framework is presented to deal with noisy outputs in regression and ordinal classification problems. Firstly, two necessary and sufficient conditions for a fixed goodness of fit in regression are deduced from the perspective of GE bound. They provide the unified theoretical framework for determining the filtering effectiveness and optimizing the size of removed samples. The optimal sample size has the adaptability to the environmental changes in the sample size, the noise ratio, and noise variance. It offers a choice of tuning the hyper-parameter and could prevent filters from overcleansing. Meanwhile, the OSS framework can be integrated with any noise estimator and produces a new filter. Then the covering interval is proposed to separate low-noise and high-noise samples, and the effectiveness is proved in regression. The covering distance is introduced as an unbiased estimator of high noises. Further, the CDF algorithm is designed by integrating the cover distance with the OSS framework. Finally, it is verified that the CDF not only recognizes noise labels correctly but also brings down the prediction errors on real apparent age data set. Experimental results on benchmark regression and ordinal classification data sets demonstrate that the CDF outperforms the state-of-the-art filters in terms of prediction ability, noise recognition, and efficiency.",,,,,,"Jiang, Gaoxia/0000-0002-2343-1132",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2021,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000628529500018,0

When the support points of the barycenter are pre-specified, this problem can be modeled as a linear programming (LP) problem whose size can be extremely large. To handle this large-scale LP, we analyse the structure of its dual problem, which is conceivably more tractable and can be reformulated as a well-structured convex problem with 3 kinds of block variables and a coupling linear equality constraint. We then adapt a symmetric Gauss-Seidel based alternating direction method of multipliers (sGS-ADMM) to solve the resulting dual problem and establish its global convergence and global linear convergence rate. As a critical component for efficient computation, we also show how all the subproblems involved can be solved exactly and efficiently. This makes our method suitable for computing a Wasserstein barycenter on a large-scale data set, without introducing an entropy regularization term as is commonly practiced. In addition, our sGS-ADMM can be used as a subroutine in an alternating minimization method to compute a barycenter when its support points are not pre-specified.

Recently, Reddi et al. (2015) proposed an unified variance reduction framework (i.e., HSAG) to analyze the asynchronous stochastic gradient optimization. However, the HSAG framework cannot incorporate the S2GD technique, the analysis of the HSAG framework is limited to the SVRG and SAGA techniques on the smooth convex optimization. They did not analyze other important various variance techniques (e.g., S2GD and q-SAGA) and other important optimization problems (e.g., convex optimization with non-smooth regularization and non-convex optimization with cardinality constraint). In this paper, we bridge this gap by using an unified q-memorization framework for various variance reduction techniques (including SVRG, S2GD, SAGA, q-SAGA) to analyze asynchronous stochastic algorithms for three important optimization problems. Specifically, based on the q-memorization framework, 1) we propose an asynchronous stochastic gradient hard thresh-olding algorithm with q-memorization (AsySGHT-qM) for the non-convex optimization with cardinality constraint, and prove that the convergence rate of AsySGHT-qM before reaching the inherent error induced by gradient hard thresholding methods is geometric. 2) We propose an asynchronous stochastic proximal gradient algorithm (AsySPG-qM) for the convex optimization with non-smooth regularization, and prove that AsySPG-q M can achieve a linear convergence rate. 3) We propose an asynchronous stochastic gradient descent algorithm (AsySGD-qM) for the general non-convex optimization problem, and prove that AsySGD-qM can achieve a sublinear convergence rate to stationary points.

The introduced two constraints are imposed either exactly (on small data sets) or approximately (on large data sets) in our model, which provides a controllable trade-off between model flexibility and complexity with theoretical demonstration. In algorithm optimization, the objective function of our learning framework is proven to be gradient-Lipschitz continuous.

In the Bayesian framework for regression trees, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) search algorithms are required to generate samples of tree models according to their posterior probabilities. The critical component of such MCMC algorithms is to construct good Metropolis-Hastings steps to update the tree topology. Such algorithms frequently suffer from poor mixing and local mode stickiness; therefore, the algorithms are slow to converge. Hitherto, authors have primarily used discrete-time birth/death mechanisms for Bayesian (sums of) regression tree models to explore the tree-model space. These algorithms are efficient, in terms of computation and convergence, only if the rejection rate is low which is not always the case. We overcome this issue by developing a novel search algorithm which is based on a continuous-time birth-death Markov process. The search algorithm explores the tree-model space by jumping between parameter spaces corresponding to different tree structures. The jumps occur in continuous time corresponding to the birth-death events which are modeled as independent Poisson processes. In the proposed algorithm, the moves between models are always accepted which can dramatically improve the convergence and mixing properties of the search algorithm. We provide theoretical support of the algorithm for Bayesian regression tree models and demonstrate its performance in a simulated example.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,,2020,21,,,,,,,,201,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000590006000001,0

In the context of reservoir computing, much effort has been devoted in the last two decades to characterize the situations in which systems of this type exhibit the so-called echo state (ESP) and fading memory (FMP) properties. These important features amount, in mathematical terms, to the existence and continuity of global reservoir system solutions. That research is complemented in this paper with the characterization of the differentiability of reservoir filters for very general classes of discrete-time deterministic inputs. This constitutes a novel strong contribution to the long line of research on the ESP and the FMP and, in particular, links to existing research on the input-dependence of the ESP. Differentiability has been shown in the literature to be a key feature in the learning of attractors of chaotic dynamical systems. A Volterra-type series representation for reservoir filters with semi -infinite discrete-time inputs is constructed in the analytic case using Taylor's theorem and corresponding approximation bounds are provided.

The main challenge is that, unlike in the i.i.d. setting, the distributions of the sampled pay-offs may not have the same characteristics as those of the original bandit arms. In particular, the phi-mixing property does not necessarily carry over. This is overcome by carefully controlling the effect of a sampling policy on the pay-off distributions.

Furthermore, string GP priors naturally cope with heterogeneous input data, and the gradient of the learned latent function is readily available for explanatory analysis.

In these contexts, there is often interest in making predictions about future interactions, such as who will message whom. A popular approach to network modeling in a Bayesian context is to assume that the observed interactions can be explained in terms of some latent structure. For example, traffic patterns might be explained by the size and importance of cities, and social network interactions might be explained by the social groups and interests of individuals. Unfortunately, while elucidating this structure can be useful, it often does not directly translate into an effective predictive tool. Further, many existing approaches are not appropriate for sparse networks, a class that includes many interesting real-world situations. In this paper, we develop models for sparse networks that combine structure elucidation with predictive performance. We use a Bayesian nonparametric approach, which allows us to predict interactions with entities outside our training set, and allows the both the latent dimensionality of the model and the number of nodes in the network to grow in expectation as we see more data.

The size (the number of DAGs) of a Markov equivalence class is crucial to infer causal effects or to learn the exact causal DAG via further interventions. Given a set of Markov equivalence classes, the distribution of their sizes is a key consideration in developing learning methods. However, counting the size of an equivalence class with many vertices is usually computationally infeasible, and the existing literature reports the size distributions only for equivalence classes with ten or fewer vertices. In this paper, we develop a method to compute the size of a Markov equivalence class. We first show that there are five types of Markov equivalence classes whose sizes can be formulated as five functions of the number of vertices respectively. Then we introduce a new concept of a rooted sub-class. The graph representations of rooted subclasses of a Markov equivalence class are used to partition this class recursively until the sizes of all rooted subclasses can be computed via the five functions. The proposed size counting is efficient for Markov equivalence classes of sparse DAGs with hundreds of vertices. Finally, we explore the size and edge distributions of Markov equivalence classes and find experimentally that, in general, (1) most Markov equivalence classes are half completed and their average sizes are small, and (2) the sizes of sparse classes grow approximately exponentially with the numbers of vertices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4435,,,,,DEC,2015,16,,,,,,2589,2609,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000369888000008,0

As part of this analysis, we introduce a problem for which rules are particularly natural, called sequential event prediction. In sequential event prediction, events in a sequence are revealed one by one, and the goal is to determine which event will next be revealed. The training set is a collection of past sequences of events. An example application is to predict which item will next be placed into a customer's online shopping cart, given his/her past purchases. In the context of this problem, algorithms based on association rules have distinct advantages over classical statistical and machine learning methods: they look at correlations based on subsets of co-occurring past events (items a and b imply item c), they can be applied to the sequential event prediction problem in a natural way, they can potentially handle the cold start problem where the training set is small, and they yield interpretable predictions. In this work, we present two algorithms that incorporate association rules. These algorithms can be used both for sequential event prediction and for supervised classification, and they are simple enough that they can possibly be understood by users, customers, patients, managers, etc. We provide generalization guarantees on these algorithms based on algorithmic stability analysis from statistical learning theory.

In web search, existing work has designed relevance models to match queries and documents by exploiting either user clicks or content of queries and documents. To the best of our knowledge, however, there has been little work on principled approaches to leveraging both clicks and content to learn a matching model for search. In this paper, we propose a framework for learning to match heterogeneous objects. The framework learns two linear mappings for two objects respectively, and matches them via the dot product of their images after mapping. Moreover, when different regularizations are enforced, the framework renders a rich family of matching models. With orthonormal constraints on mapping functions, the framework subsumes Partial Least Squares (PLS) as a special case. Alternatively, with a l(1) + l(2) regularization, we obtain a new model called Regularized Mapping to Latent Structures (RMLS). RMLS enjoys many advantages over PLS, including lower time complexity and easy parallelization. To further understand the matching framework, we conduct generalization analysis and apply the result to both PLS and RMLS. We apply the framework to web search and implement both PLS and RMLS using a click-through bipartite with metadata representing features of queries and documents. We test the efficacy and scalability of RMLS and PLS on large scale web search problems.

But even with the best available algorithms, finding the lasso solutions remains a computationally challenging task in cases where the number of covariates vastly exceeds the number of data points. Marginal regression, where each dependent variable is regressed separately on each covariate, offers a promising alternative in this case because the estimates can be computed roughly two orders faster than the lasso solutions. The question that remains is how the statistical performance of the method compares to that of the lasso in these cases. In this paper, we study the relative statistical performance of the lasso and marginal regression for sparse, high-dimensional regression problems. We consider the problem of learning which coefficients are non-zero. Our main results are as follows: (i) we compare the conditions under which the lasso and marginal regression guarantee exact recovery in the fixed design, noise free case; (ii) we establish conditions under which marginal regression provides exact recovery with high probability in the fixed design, noise free, random coefficients case; and (iii) we derive rates of convergence for both procedures, where performance is measured by the number of coefficients with incorrect sign, and characterize the regions in the parameter space recovery is and is not possible under this metric.

While much interest has been devoted to the study of cost-sensitive learning techniques, the relationship between cost-sensitive learning and the specification of the model set in a parametric estimation framework remains somewhat unclear. To that end, we differentiate between the case of the model including the true posterior, and that in which the model is misspecified. In the former case, it is shown that thresholding the maximum likelihood (ML) estimate is an asymptotically optimal solution to the risk minimization problem. On the other hand, under model misspecification, it is demonstrated that thresholded ML is suboptimal and that the risk-minimizing solution varies with the misclassification cost ratio. Moreover, we analytically show that the negative weighted log likelihood (Elkan, 2001) is a tight, convex upper bound of the empirical loss.

The false discovery rate (FDR), the expected ratio of falsely claimed connections to all those claimed, is often a reasonable error-rate criterion in these applications. However, current learning algorithms for graphical models have not been adequately adapted to the concerns of the FDR. The traditional practice of controlling the type I error rate and the type II error rate under a conventional level does not necessarily keep the FDR low, especially in the case of sparse networks. In this paper, we propose embedding an FDR-control procedure into the PC algorithm to curb the FDR of the skeleton of the learned graph. We prove that the proposed method can control the FDR under a user-specified level at the limit of large sample sizes. In the cases of moderate sample size (about several hundred), empirical experiments show that the method is still able to control the FDR under the user-specified level, and a heuristic modification of the method is able to control the FDR more accurately around the user-specified level.

When the space of potential features is large, streamwise feature selection offers many advantages over traditional feature selection methods, which assume that all features are known in advance. Features can be generated dynamically, focusing the search for new features on promising subspaces, and overfitting can be controlled by dynamically adjusting the threshold for adding features to the model. In contrast to traditional forward feature selection algorithms such as stepwise regression in which at each step all possible features are evaluated and the best one is selected, streamwise feature selection only evaluates each feature once when it is generated. We describe information-investing and alpha-investing, two adaptive complexity penalty methods for streamwise feature selection which dynamically adjust the threshold on the error reduction required for adding a new feature. These two methods give false discovery rate style guarantees against overfitting. They differ from standard penalty methods such as AIC, BIC and RIC, which always drastically over- or under-fit in the limit of infinite numbers of non-predictive features.

The purpose of ensemble pruning is to search for a good subset of ensemble members that performs as well as, or better than, the original ensemble. This subset selection problem is a combinatorial optimization problem and thus finding the exact optimal solution is computationally prohibitive. Various heuristic methods have been developed to obtain an approximate solution. However, most of the existing heuristics use simple greedy search as the optimization method, which lacks either theoretical or empirical quality guarantees.

For ensembles where the individual estimators output crisp class labels, this 'diversity' is not well understood and remains an open research issue. For ensembles of regression estimators, the diversity can be exactly formulated in terms of the covariance between individual estimator outputs, and the optimum level is expressed in terms of a bias-variance-covariance trade-off. Despite this, most approaches to learning ensembles use heuristics to encourage the right degree of diversity. In this work we show how to explicitly control diversity through the error function. The first contribution of this paper is to show that by taking the combination mechanism for the ensemble into account we can derive an error function for each individual that balances ensemble diversity with individual accuracy. We show the relationship between this error function and an existing algorithm called negative correlation learning, which uses a heuristic penalty term added to the mean squared error function. It is demonstrated that these methods control the bias-variance-covariance trade-off systematically, and can be utilised with any estimator capable of minimising a quadratic error function, for example MLPs, or RBF networks. As a second contribution, we derive a strict upper bound on the coefficient of the penalty term, which holds for any estimator that can be cast in a generalised linear regression framework, with mild assumptions on the basis functions.

As opposed to traditional multidimensional scaling techniques, which minimize the distortion of pairwise distances, our embedding algorithm seeks a low-dimensional representation of the data that preserves the structure (geometry) of the original data. The algorithm uses a hybrid criterion function that combines the pairwise distortion with what we call the geometric distortion. To assess the geometric distortion, we explore functions that reflect geometric properties. Our approach is different from the Isomap and LLE algorithms in that the discrepancy in distributional information is used to guide the embedding. We use clustering algorithms in conjunction with our embedding algorithm to direct the embedding process and improve its convergence properties. We test our method on metric and nonmetric data sets, and in the presence of noise. We demonstrate that our method preserves the structural properties of embedded data better than traditional MDS, and that its performance is robust with respect to clustering errors in the original data.

In particular we derive a simple sufficient condition for this parameter in the case of Gaussian RBF kernels. On the one hand our considerations are based on an investigation of an approximation property-the so-called universality-of the used kernels that ensures that all continuous functions can be approximated by certain kernel expressions. This approximation property also gives a new insight into the role of kernels in these and other algorithms. On the other hand the results are achieved by a precise study of the underlying optimization problems of the classifiers. Furthermore, we show consistency for the maximal margin classifier as well as for the soft margin SVMs in the presence of large margins.

This paper shows that these two algorithms can collaborate through a simple exchange mechanism, in which they swap their current positions if LD yields a lower objective function. This idea can be seen as the singular limit of the replica-exchange technique from the sampling literature. We show that this new algorithm converges to the global minimum linearly with high probability, assuming the objective function is strongly convex in a neighborhood of the unique global minimum. By replacing gradients with stochastic gradients, and adding a proper threshold to the exchange mechanism, our algorithm can also be used in online settings.

The latter equation is used to estimate the factors that are subsequently used in estimating the parameters of the VAR system. The FAVAR model has become popular in applied economic research, since it can summarize a large number of variables of interest as a few factors through the calibration equation and subsequently examine their influence on core variables of primary interest through the VAR equation. However, there is increasing need for examining lead-lag relationships between a large number of time series, while incorporating information from another high-dimensional set of variables. Hence, in this paper we investigate the FAVAR model under high-dimensional scaling. We introduce an appropriate identification constraint for the model parameters, which when incorporated into the formulated optimization problem yields estimates with good statistical properties. Further, we address a number of technical challenges introduced by the fact that estimates of the VAR system model parameters are based on estimated rather than directly observed quantities. The performance of the proposed estimators is evaluated on synthetic data.

We consider a class of estimators for optimal treatment rules that are analogous to convex large-margin classifiers.

In this paper, we develop the Hidden Absorbing Semi-Markov Model (HASMM): a versatile probabilistic model that is capable of capturing the modern electronic health record (EHR) data. Unlike existing models, the HASMM accommodates irregularly sampled, temporally correlated, and informatively censored physiological data, and can describe non-stationary clinical state transitions. Learning the HASMM parameters from the EHR data is achieved via a novel forward-filtering backward-sampling Monte-Carlo EM algorithm that exploits the knowledge of the end-point clinical outcomes (informative censoring) in the EHR data, and implements the E-step by sequentially sampling the patients' clinical states in the reverse-time direction while conditioning on the future states. Real-time inferences are drawn via a forward-filtering algorithm that operates on a virtually constructed discrete-time embedded Markov chain that mirrors the patient's continuous-time state trajectory. We demonstrate the prognostic utility of the HASMM in a critical care prognosis setting using a real-world dataset for patients admitted to the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center.
