We analyze the convexity properties of the objective, and propose a few bounds which are fully convex, two of which jointly convex in the mean and standard-deviation under certain conditions. We derive new forward algorithms analogous to recent boosting algorithms, providing novel relations between boosting and PAC-Bayes analysis.

Our algorithm allows CFL to scale to corpuses comprised of millions of documents because each step is linear in the corpus length and highly parallelizable. We use it to extract features from the BeerAdvocate dataset, a corpus of over 1.5 million beer reviews spanning 10 years. CFL uses two orders of magnitude fewer features than the full trigram space.

In this paper, we consider the effect of feature noise in active learning, which could arise either because X itself is being measured, or it is corrupted in transmission to the oracle, or the oracle returns the label of a noisy version of the query point. In statistics, feature noise is known as errors in variables and has been studied extensively in non-active settings. However, the effect of feature noise in active learning has not been studied before. We consider the well-known Berkson errors-in-variables model with additive uniform noise of width sigma. Our simple but revealing setting is that of one-dimensional binary classification setting where the goal is to learn a threshold (point where the probability of a + label crosses half). We deal with regression functions that are antisymmetric in a region of size a around the threshold and also satisfy Tsybakov's margin condition around the threshold. We prove minimax lower and upper bounds which demonstrate that when a is smaller than the minimiax active/passive noiseless error derived in Castro & Nowak (2007), then noise has no effect on the rates and one achieves the same noiseless rates. For larger sigma, the unfiattening of the regression function on convolution with uniform noise, along with its local antisymmetry around the threshold, together yield a behaviour where noise appears to be beneficial. Our key result is that active learning can buy significant improvement over a passive strategy even in the presence of feature noise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1938-7288,,,,,,2014,33,,,,,,805,813,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000508355800089,0

Logistic regression has been widely used for CPE, while it tends to underestimate the probability of rare events. Its main drawback is symmetry of the logit link-symmetric links can be misled by small and imbalanced samples because it is more incentivized to overestimate the majority class with finite samples. Parametric skewed links have been proposed to overcome this limitation, but their estimation usually results in nonconvex optimization unlike the logit link. Such nonconvexity is knotty not only from the computational viewpoint but also in terms of the parameter identifiability. In this paper, we provide a procedure to derive a convex loss for a skewed link based on the recently proposed FenchelYoung losses. The derived losses are always convex and have a nice property suitable for class imbalance. The simulation shows the practicality of the derived losses.",,,,,"Sugiyama, Masashi/AEO-1176-2022","Sugiyama, Masashi/0000-0001-6658-6743",,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2021,130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000659893802003,0

When these relationships have different modalities, they are better modelled by multilayer graphs in which each layer is associated with one modality. Such graphs arise naturally in many contexts including biological and social networks. Clustering is a fundamental problem in network analysis where the goal is to regroup nodes with similar connectivity profiles. In the past decade, various clustering methods have been extended from the unilayer setting to multilayer graphs in order to incorporate the information provided by each layer. While most existing works assume - rather restrictively - that all layers share the same set of nodes, we propose a new framework that allows for layers to be defined on different sets of nodes. In particular, the nodes not recorded in a layer are treated as missing. Within this paradigm, we investigate several generalizations of well-known clustering methods in the complete setting to the incomplete one and prove some consistency results under the Multi-Layer Stochastic Block Model assumption. Our theoretical results are complemented by thorough numerical comparisons between our proposed algorithms on synthetic data, and also on real datasets, thus highlighting the promising behaviour of our methods in various settings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2021,130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000659893802071,0

But the algorithm is not guaranteed to converge to the desired distribution in the case of multivariate binary distributions (e.g., Ising models or stochastic neural networks such as Boltzmann machines) if the variables (sites or neurons) are updated in a fixed order, a setting commonly used in practice. The reason is that the corresponding Markov chain may not be irreducible. We propose a modified Metropolis transition operator that behaves almost always identically to the standard Metropolis operator and prove that it ensures irreducibility and convergence to the limiting distribution in the multivariate binary case with fixed-order updates. The result provides an explanation for the behaviour of Metropolis MCMC in that setting and closes a long-standing theoretical gap. We experimentally studied the standard and modified Metropolis operator for models where they actually behave differently. If the standard algorithm also converges, the modified operator exhibits similar (if not better) performance in terms of convergence speed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2021,130,,,,,,469,+,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000659893800053,0

A weighted sample of keys by (a function of) frequency is a highly versatile summary that provides a sparse set of representative keys and supports approximate evaluations of query statistics. We propose private weighted sampling (PWS): A method that sanitizes a weighted sample as to ensure elementlevel differential privacy, while retaining its utility to the maximum extent possible. PWS maximizes the reporting probabilities of keys and estimation quality of a broad family of statistics. PWS improves over the state of the art even for the well-studied special case of private histograms, when no sampling is performed. We empirically observe significant performance gains of 20%-300% increase in key reporting for common Zipfian frequency distributions and accurate estimation with x2-8 lower frequencies. PWS is applied as a post-processing of a non-private sample, without requiring the original data. Therefore, it can be a seamless addition to existing implementations, such as those optimizes for distributed or streamed data. We believe that due to practicality and performance, PWS may become a method of choice in applications where privacy is desired.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2021,130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000659893802087,0

In the first setting, we consider the K armed mixture bandits, where the mean reward of arm i is an element of [K](2), is mu(i) + <alpha(i,t), theta*>, with alpha(i,t) is an element of R-d being the known context vector and mu(i) is an element of [-1, 1] and theta* are unknown parameters. We define(3) parallel to theta*parallel to as the problem complexity and consider a sequence of nested hypothesis classes, each positing a different upper bound on parallel to theta*parallel to. Exploiting this, we propose Adaptive Linear Bandit (ALB), a novel phase based algorithm that adapts to the true problem complexity, parallel to theta*parallel to. We show that ALB achieves regret scaling of(4) (O) over tilde(parallel to theta*parallel to root T), where parallel to theta*parallel to is apriori unknown. As a corollary, when theta* = 0, ALB recovers the minimax regret for the simple bandit algorithm without such knowledge of theta*. ALB is the first algorithm that uses parameter norm as model section criteria for linear bandits. Prior state of art algorithms (Chatterji et al. (2019)) achieve a regret of (O) over tilde (L root T), where L is the upper bound on parallel to theta*parallel to, fed as an input to the problem. In the second setting, we consider the standard linear bandit problem (with possibly an infinite number of arms) where the sparsity of theta*, denoted by d* <= d, is unknown to the algorithm. Defining d* as the problem complexity (similar to Foster et al. (2019)), we show that ALB achieves (O) over tilde (d*root T) regret, matching that of an oracle who knew the true sparsity level. This is the first algorithm that achieves such model selection guarantees. This methodology is then extended to the case of finitely many arms and similar results are proven. We further verify through synthetic and real-data experiments that the performance gains are fundamental and not artifacts of mathematical bounds. In particular, we show 1.5 - 3x drop in cumulative regret over non-adaptive algorithms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2021,130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000659893801069,0

We achieve this through a novel and holistic approach that uses both forward and adjoint sensitivity analysis techniques.

Since each iteration of the CLDP-SGD aggregates the client-side local gradients, we develop (optimal) communication-efficient schemes for mean estimation for several l(p) spaces under local differential privacy (LDP). To overcome performance limitation of LDP, CLDP-SGD takes advantage of the inherent privacy amplification provided by client sub-sampling and data subsampling at each selected client (through SGD) as well as the recently developed shuffed model of privacy. For convex loss functions, we prove that the proposed CLDP-SGD algorithm matches the known lower bounds on the centralized private ERM while using a finite number of bits per iteration for each client, i.e., effectively getting communication efficiency for free.

In this regard, the implicit assumption is that there exists (at least approximately) a ground-truth bijection such that a given input from either domain can be accurately reconstructed from successive application of the respective mappings. But in many applications no such bijection can be expected to exist and large reconstruction errors can compromise the success of cycle-consistent training. As one important instance of this limitation, we consider practically-relevant situations where there exists a many-to-one or surjective mapping between domains. To address this regime, we develop a conditional variational auto-encoder (CVAE) approach that can be viewed as converting surjective mappings to implicit bijections whereby reconstruction errors in both directions can be minimized, and as a natural byproduct, realistic output diversity can be obtained in the one-to-many direction. As theoretical motivation, we analyze a simplified scenario whereby minima of the proposed CVAE-based energy function align with the recovery of ground-truth surjective mappings. On the empirical side, we consider a synthetic image dataset with known ground-truth, as well as a real-world application involving natural language generation from knowledge graphs and vice versa, a prototypical surjective case. For the latter, our CVAE pipeline can capture such many-to-one mappings during cycle training while promoting textural diversity for graph-to-text tasks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2021,130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000659893802023,0

We resolve a long-standing question that many recent results have attempted to tackle: we completely characterize the convergence behavior of EM, and show that the EM algorithm achieves minimax optimal sample complexity under all SNR regimes. In particular, when the SNR is sufficiently large, the EM updates converge to the true parameter theta* at the standard parametric convergence rate O((d/n)(1/2)) after O(log(n/d)) iterations. In the regime where the SNR is above O((d/n)(1/4)) and below some constant, the EM iterates converge to a O(SNR-1 (d/n)(1/2)) neighborhood of the true parameter, when the number of iterations is of the order O(SNR-2 log(n/d)). In the low SNR regime where the SNR is below O((d/n)(1/4)), we show that EM converges to a O((d/n)(1/4)) neighborhood of the true parameters, after O((n/d)(1/2)) iterations. Notably, these results are achieved under mild conditions of either random initialization or an efficiently computable local initialization. By providing tight convergence guarantees of the EM algorithm in middle-to-low SNR regimes, we fill the remaining gap in the literature, and significantly, reveal that in low SNR, EM changes rate, matching the n(-1/4) rate of the MLE, a behavior that previous work had been unable to show.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2021,130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000659893801070,0

The EPT is shown to be equivalent to a standard complete OT problem on a one-node extended tree. We derive its dual formulation, then leverage this to propose a novel regularization for EPT which admits fast computation and negative definiteness. To our knowledge, the proposed regularized EPT is the first approach that yields a closed-form solution among available variants of unbalanced OT for general nonnegative measures. For practical applications without prior knowledge about the tree structure for measures, we propose tree-sliced variants of the regularized EPT, computed by averaging the regularized EPT between these measures using random tree metrics, built adaptively from support data points. Exploiting the negative definiteness of our regularized EPT, we introduce a positive definite kernel, and evaluate it against other baselines on benchmark tasks such as document classification with word embedding and topological data analysis.

In this work we challenge the common wisdom that optimizing the inducing inputs in the variational framework yields optimal performance. We show that, by revisiting old model approximations such as the fully-independent training conditionals endowed with powerful sampling-based inference methods, treating both inducing locations and GP hyper-parameters in a Bayesian way can improve performance significantly.

A variety of methods, such as Bayesian optimization, have been developed to automate and expedite this process.

To address this issue, Bayesian optimization has been extended to use cheap, partially trained models to extrapolate to expensive complete models. This approach enlarges the set of explored hyperparameters, but including many low-fidelity observations adds to the intrinsic randomness of the procedure and makes extrapolation challenging. We propose to accelerate tuning of neural networks in a robust way by taking into account the relative amount of information contributed by each training example.

Casting hyperparameter search as a multi-task Bayesian optimization problem over both hyperparameters and IS design achieves the best of both worlds. By learning a parameterization of IS that tradeso. evaluation complexity and quality, our method improves upon validation error, in the average and worst-case, while using higher fidelity observations with less data.

This is an improvement over the best existing bound of O (T-3/4) for the average-reward case with function approximation. Our algorithm and analysis rely on online learning techniques, where value functions are treated as losses. The main technical novelty is the use of a data-dependent adaptive learning rate coupled with a so-called optimistic prediction of upcoming losses.

Roughly speaking, we assume the large coefficients of the parameter are in correspondence to the principal components. In this setting a precise characterisation of the test error is obtained, depending on the inputs covariance and regression parameter structure. We illustrate this characterisation in a simplified setting to investigate the influence of the true parameter on optimal regularisation for overparameterized models. We show that interpolation (no regularisation) can be optimal even with bounded signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), provided that the parameter coefficients are larger on high-variance directions of the data, corresponding to a more regular function than posited by the regularization term.

Strong theoretical guarantees require taking into account the importance of each point, measured by how much its individual loss contributes to F(x). Maximizing this importance over all x is an element of chi yields the sensitivity score of a(i). Sampling with probabilities proportional to these scores gives strong guarantees, allowing one to approximately minimize of F using just the subsampled points. Unfortunately, sensitivity sampling is difficult to apply since (1) it is unclear how to efficiently compute the sensitivity scores and (2) the sample size required is often impractically large. To overcome both obstacles we introduce local sensitivity, which measures data point importance in a ball around some center x(0). We show that the local sensitivity can be efficiently estimated using the leverage scores of a quadratic approximation to F and that the sample size required to approximate F around x(0) can be bounded.

Recently Scellier and Bengio [2017], demonstrated an alternative to backpropagation, called Equilibrium Propagation, wherein gradients are implicitly computed by the dynamics of the neural network, so that neurons do not need an internal mechanism for backpropagation of gradients. This provides an interesting solution to problem (1).

Here a fully non-parametric test for continuous data based on conditional mutual information combined with a local permutation scheme is presented. Numerical experiments covering sample sizes from 50 to 2, 000 and dimensions up to 10 demonstrate that the test reliably generates the null distribution. For smooth nonlinear dependencies, the test has higher power than kernel-based tests in lower dimensions and similar power in higher dimensions. For highly non-smooth densities the data-adaptive nearest neighbor approach is particularly well-suited while kernel methods yield much lower power. The experiments also show that kernel methods utilizing an analytical approximation of the null distribution are not well-calibrated for sample sizes below 1, 000. Combining the local permutation scheme with these kernel tests leads to better calibration but lower power. For smaller sample sizes and lower dimensions, the proposed test is faster than random fourier feature-based kernel tests if (embarrassingly) parallelized, but the runtime increases more sharply with sample size and dimensionality. Thus, more theoretical research to analytically approximate the null distribution and speed up estimation is desirable.

However, such iteration complexity explicitly depends on p, and therefore is at least p times worse than those of gradient descent methods. To bridge this theoretical gap, we propose an improved convergence analysis for the CBCD-type methods. In particular, we first show that for a family of quadratic minimization problems, the iteration complexity of the CBCD-type methods matches that of the GD methods in term of dependency on p (up to a log 2 p factor). Thus our complexity bounds are sharper than the existing bounds by at least a factor of p/log(2) p. We also provide a lower bound to confirm that our improved complexity bounds are tight (up to a log(2) p factor) if the largest and smallest eigen-values of the Hessian matrix do not scale with p.

In order to achieve good generalization on unseen data, a suitable inductive bias is of great importance for neural networks. One of the most straightforward ways is to regularize the neural network with some additional objectives. l(2) regularization serves as a standard regularization for neural networks. Despite its popularity, it essentially regularizes one dimension of the individual neuron, which is not strong enough to control the capacity of highly over-parameterized neural networks. Motivated by this, hyperspherical uniformity is proposed as a novel family of relational regularizations that impact the interaction among neurons. We consider several geometrically distinct ways to achieve hyperspherical uniformity.

Such algorithms, however, may perform poorly in an environment that changes over time. To overcome this problem, we apply a tracking-regret-analysis framework to online submodular optimization, one by which output is assessed through comparison with time-varying optimal subsets. We propose algorithms for submodular minimization, monotone submodular maximization under a size constraint, and unconstrained submodular maximization, and we show tracking regret bounds.

These decisions are made by applying a decision rule to individual's observed features. Given the impacts of these decisions on individuals, decision makers are increasingly required to be transparent on their decision making to offer the right to explanation. Meanwhile, being transparent also invites potential manipulations, also known as gaming, that individuals can utilize the knowledge to strategically alter their features in order to receive a more beneficial decision. In this work, we study the problem of robust decision-making under strategic behavior. Prior works often assume that the decision maker has full knowledge of individuals' cost structure for manipulations. We study the robust variant that relaxes this assumption: The decision maker does not have full knowledge but knows only a subset of the individuals' available actions and associated costs. To approach this non-quantifiable uncertainty, we define robustness based on the worst-case guarantee of a decision, over all possible actions (including actions unknown to the decision maker) individuals might take. A decision rule is called robust optimal if its worst case performance is (weakly) better than that of all other decision rules. Our main contributions are two-fold. First, we provide a crisp characterization of the above robust optimality: For any decision rules under mild conditions that are robust optimal, there exists a linear decision rule that is equally robust optimal. Second, we explore the computational problem of searching for the robust optimal decision rule and demonstrate its connection to distributionally robust optimization. We believe our results promote the use of simple linear decisions with uncertain individual manipulations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2021,130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000659893803014,0

To combat this problem, techniques like adversarial training have been employed to obtain models that are robust on the training set.

To study how robustness generalizes, recent works assume that the inputs have bounded l(2)-norm in order to bound the adversarial risk for l(infinity) attacks with no explicit dimension dependence. In this work, we focus on l(infinity) attacks with l(infinity) bounded inputs and prove margin-based bounds. Specifically, we use a compression-based approach that relies on efficiently compressing the set of tunable parameters without distorting the adversarial risk. To achieve this, we apply the concept of effective sparsity and effective joint sparsity on the weight matrices of neural networks. This leads to bounds with no explicit dependence on the input dimension, neither on the number of classes. Our results show that neural networks with approximately sparse weight matrices not only enjoy enhanced robustness but also better generalization.

Moreover, we prove that one can achieve a strictly better success probability using more general multi-threshold algorithms, unlike the non-randomorder case. Along the way, we show that the best achievable success probability for the random-order case matches that of the i.i.d. case, which is approximately 0:5801, under a no-superstars condition that no single distribution is very likely ex ante to generate the maximum value.

In the special case of lambda = 0, this is ordinary multi-response linear regression. Our focus is on deterministically constructing coresets for this problem. Here the goal is to select and re-weight a small subset of rows of A and corresponding labels of B, denoted by SA and SB, so that if X' is the minimizer to min(X)' parallel to SAX' - SB parallel to(2)(F) + lambda parallel to X'parallel to(2)(F), then parallel to AX' - B parallel to(2)(F) + lambda parallel to X'parallel to(2)(F) <= (1 + epsilon)OPT.

In this work, we consider the setting where out of a large number of covariates X that satisfy strong ignorability, an unknown sparse subset S is sufficient to include to achieve zero bias, i.e. c-equivalent to X. We propose a common objective function involving outcomes across treatment cohorts with nonconvex joint sparsity regularization that is guaranteed to recover S with high probability under a linear outcome model for Y and subgaussian covariates for each of the treatment cohort.

However, we show that smoothness and strong convexity can be heavily impacted by arbitrarily small perturbations, leading to excessively conservative tunings and convergence issues. In view of these observations, we propose a notion of continuity of the metrics, which is essential for a robust tuning strategy. Since smoothness and strong convexity are not continuous, we propose a comprehensive study of existing alternative metrics which we prove to be continuous.

This linear scaling in n enables inference for very large data sets; however the cost is per-iteration, which remains a limitation for extremely large n.

With per-iteration complexity independent of the dataset size n for a fixed grid, our method scales to truly massive data sets.

To address this important issue, we initiate the study of a novel graphical model selection problem, where the goal is to optimize the total number of scalar samples obtained by allowing the collection of samples from only subsets of the variables. We propose a general paradigm for graphical model selection where feedback is used to guide the sampling to high degree vertices, while obtaining only few samples from the ones with the low degrees.

Whereas the sample complexity of passive algorithms is typically a function of the maximum degree of the graph, we show that the sample complexity of our algorithms is provably smaller and that it depends on a novel local complexity measure that is akin to the average degree of the graph.

On both synthetic and real-world time series, the proposed nonparametric Bayesian dynamic models, which are initialized at random, consistently exhibit good predictive performance in comparison to a variety of baseline models, revealing interpretable latent state transition patterns and decomposing the time series into distinctly behaved sub-sequences.",,,,,"Zhou, Mingyuan/AAE-8717-2021",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2021,130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000659893804085,0

Consequently, a group that is inherently harder to classify may hold back the performance on other groups; and no guarantees can be provided for unforeseen groups. Instead, we propose a fairness notion whose guarantee, on each group g in a class G, is relative to the performance of the best classifier on g. We apply this notion to broad classes of groups, in particular, where (a) G consists of all possible groups (subsets) in the data, and (b) G is more streamlined. For the first setting, which is akin to groups being completely unknown, we devise the PF (Proportional Fairness) classifier, which guarantees, on any possible group g, an accuracy that is proportional to that of the optimal classifier for g, scaled by the relative size of g in the data set. Due to including all possible groups, some of which could be too complex to be relevant, the worst-case theoretical guarantees here have to be proportionally weaker for smaller subsets. For the second setting, we devise the BeFair (Best-effort Fair) framework which seeks an accuracy, on every g is an element of G, which approximates that of the optimal classifier on g, independent of the size of g. Aiming for such a guarantee results in a non-convex problem, and we design novel techniques to get around this difficulty when G is the set of linear hypotheses. We test our algorithms on realworld data sets, and present interesting comparative insights on their performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2021,130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000659893803089,0

The adaptive complexity of a problem is the minimal number of sequential rounds required to achieve the objective. Our algorithm is suitable to maximize a nonmonotone submodular function under a psystem side constraint, and it achieves a (p + O(root p)-approximation for this problem, after only poly-logarithmic adaptive rounds and polynomial queries to the valuation oracle function.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages recent advances in stochastic approximate gradient ascent incorporated with a smoothed variational MI estimator for efficient and robust BED.

For proving the achievability, we propose a two-step polynomial time algorithm that provably achieves the fundamental limit in the sparse hypergraph regime. For proving the optimality, the lower bound of the minimax risk is set by finding a smaller parameter space which contains the most dominant error events, inspired by the analysis in the achievability part. It turns out that the minimax risk decays exponentially fast to zero as the number of nodes tends to infinity, and the rate function is a weighted combination of several divergence terms, each of which is the Renyi divergence of order 1/2 between two Bernoulli distributions.

In order to evaluate the performance of the learner in this setup, we use a performance metric called the contextual Pareto regret. Essentially, the contextual Pareto regret is the sum of the distances of the arms chosen by the learner to the context dependent Pareto front. For this problem, we develop a new online learning algorithm called Pareto Contextual Zooming (PCZ), which exploits the idea of contextual zooming to learn the arms that are close to the Pareto front for each observed context by adaptively partitioning the joint context-arm set according to the observed rewards and locations of the contextarm pairs selected in the past. Then, we prove that PCZ achieves (O) over tilde (T(1+dp)/(2+dp)) Pareto regret where d(p) is the Pareto zooming dimension that depends on the size of the set of near-optimal context-arm pairs.

Motivated by the problem of optimizing job assignments to train novice workers of unknown quality in labor platforms, we consider a new objective in the classical setup. Instead of maximizing the expected total reward from T pulls, we consider the vector of cumulative rewards earned from the K arms at the end of T pulls, and aim to maximize the expected value of the highest cumulative reward across the K arms. This corresponds to the objective of training a single, highly skilled worker using a limited supply of training jobs. For this new objective, we show that any policy must incur an instance-dependent asymptotic regret of Omega(log T) (with a higher instance-dependent constant compared to the traditional objective) and an instanceindependent regret of Omega((KT2/3)-T-1/3). We then design an explore-then-commit policy, featuring exploration based on appropriately tuned confidence bounds on the mean reward and an adaptive stopping criterion, which adapts to the problem difficulty and achieves these bounds (up to logarithmic factors).

An example of an attack method based on a non-additive threat model is the Wasserstein adversarial attack proposed by Wong et al. (2019), where the distance between an image and its adversarial example is determined by the Wasserstein metric (earth-mover distance) between their normalized pixel intensities. Until now, there has been no certifiable defense against this type of attack.

We develop this certificate by considering the space of possible flows between images, and representing this space such that Wasserstein distance between images is upper-bounded by L-1 distance in this flow-space. We can then apply existing randomized smoothing certificates for the L-1 metric.

Existing approaches typically use cross-validation to impose this smoothing, which is uniform across all training data.

The main issue with exploiting deeper graph information is the rapidly growing time and space complexity when incorporating information from these neighborhoods. In this paper, we propose using Graph DNA, a novel Deep Neighborhood Aware graph encoding algorithm, for exploiting multi-hop neighborhood information. DNA encoding computes approximate deep neighborhood information in linear time using Bloom filters, and results in a per-node encoding whose dimension is logarithmic in the number of nodes in the graph. It can be used in conjunction with both feature-based and graph-regularization-based collaborative filtering algorithms. Graph DNA has the advantages of being memory and time efficient and providing additional regularization when compared to directly using higher order graph information. We provide theoretical performance bounds for graph DNA encoding, and experimentally show that graph DNA can be used with 4 popular collaborative filtering algorithms to consistently boost their performances with little computational and memory overhead.",,,,,"WU, LIWEI/ABG-4582-2021",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2020,108,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000559931303081,0

This paper introduces a new MDP transition model defined by a collection of linearly parameterized exponential families with d unknown parameters. For finite-horizon episodic RL with horizon H in this MDP model, we propose a model-based upper confidence RL algorithm (Exp-UCRL) that solves a penalized maximum likelihood estimation problem to learn the d-dimensional representation of the transition distribution, balancing the exploitation-exploration tradeoff using confidence sets in the exponential family space. We demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm by proving a frequentist (worst-case) regret bound that is of order O (d root(HN)-N-3), sub-linear in total time N, linear in dimension d, and polynomial in the planning horizon H. This is achieved by deriving a novel concentration inequality for conditional exponential families that might be of independent interest.

One standard approach is to maximize a score function on the space of labels, which usually decomposes as a sum of unary and pairwise potentials, each depending on one or two specific labels, respectively. For this approach, several learning and inference algorithms have been proposed over the years, ranging from exact to approximate methods while balancing the computational complexity. However, in contrast to binary and multiclass classification, results on the necessary number of samples for achieving learning are still limited, even for a specific family of predictors such as factor graphs. In this work, we provide minimax lower bounds for a class of general factor-graph inference models in the context of structured prediction.

We provide a novel notion of a Wasserstein ambiguity set specifically tailored to this estimation problem, leading to a tractable class of regularized estimators. Special cases include penalized likelihood estimators for Gaussian data, specifically the graphical lasso estimator. As a consequence of this formulation, the radius of the Wasserstein ambiguity set is directly related to the regularization parameter in the estimation problem. Using this relationship, the level of robustness of the estimation procedure can be shown to correspond to the level of confidence with which the ambiguity set contains a distribution with the population covariance. Furthermore, a unique feature of our formulation is that the radius can be expressed in closed-form as a function of the ordinary sample covariance matrix. Taking advantage of this finding, we develop a simple algorithm to determine a regularization parameter for graphical lasso, using only the bootstrapped sample covariance matrices, meaning that computationally expensive repeated evaluation of the graphical lasso algorithm is not necessary. Alternatively, the distributionally robust formulation can also quantify the robustness of the corresponding estimator if one uses an off-the-shelf method such as cross-validation.

Less emphasis has been given to aligning these algorithms to the challenges of big data. In this paper, we focus on clustering n samples from an arbitrary mixture of c-separated Gaussians in I p in time that is linear in p and n, and sample complexity that is independent of p.

Specifically, for a user-specified error e, the expected number of such projections is small and bounded by o(ln p) when < cln In p and ry= Q -1(e) is the separation of the Gaussians with Q as the tail distribution function of the normal distribution. Consequently, the expected overall running time of the algorithm is linear in n and quasilinear in p at o(ln p)O(np), and the sample complexity is independent of p.

Namely, we show that successive predictive scores may converge to a point where they predict their own effect, or may eventually tend toward a stable oscillation between two values, and we argue that neither outcome is desirable. Furthermore, we demonstrate that even if model-fitting procedures improve, actual performance may worsen.

For Holder continuous functions, approaches based on random sampling in bins of a discretized domain suffices as optimal. In contrast, we propose a class of two-layer algorithms that deploy misspecified linear/polynomial bandit algorithms in bins. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can exploit higher-order smoothness of the function by deriving a regret upper bound of (O) over tilde (Td+alpha/d+2 alpha) for when alpha > 1, which matches existing lower bound.

Such decision making processes often lead to what is known as the information cascade or herding phenomenon. Specifically, a cascade develops when it seems rational for some players to abandon their own private information and imitate the actions of earlier players. The risk, however, is that if the initial decisions were wrong, then the whole cascade will be wrong. Nonetheless, information cascade are known to be fragile: there exists a sequence of revealing probabilities {p(l)}(l >= 1), such that if with probability p(l) player l ignores the decisions of previous players, and rely on his private information only, then wrong cascades can be avoided. Previous related papers which study the fragility of information cascades always assume that the revealing probabilities are known to all players perfectly, which might be unrealistic in practice. Accordingly, in this paper we study a mismatch model where players believe that the revealing probabilities are {q(l)}(l is an element of N) when they truly are {p(l)}(l is an element of N), and study the effect of this mismatch on information cascades.

For example, the vector of residual/primal variables has to be maintained when CD is applied for Lasso/linear SVM, respectively. An implementation without maintenance is O(n) times slower than the one with maintenance, where n is the number of variables. In serial implementations, maintaining auxiliary variables is only a computing trick without changing the behavior of coordinate descent. However, maintenance of auxiliary variables is non-trivial when there are multiple threads/workers which read/write the auxiliary variables concurrently. Thus, most existing theoretical analysis of parallel CD either assumes vanilla CD without auxiliary variables (which ends up being extremely slow in practice) or limits to a small class of problems. In this paper, we consider a rich family of objective functions where AUX-PCD can be applied. We also establish global linear convergence for AUX-PCD with atomic operations for a general family of functions and perform a complete backward error analysis of AUX-PCD with wild updates, where some updates are not just delayed but lost because of memory conflicts.

Unlike previous work, DACLearn optimizes conditional likelihood, resulting in a more accurate conditional distribution. DACLearn also learns much more compact ACs than generative methods, since it does not need to represent a consistent distribution over the evidence variables. To ensure efficiency, DACLearn uses novel initialization and search heuristics to drastically reduce the number of feature evaluations required to learn an accurate model.

When this prior does not match the structure of the true data manifold, it can lead to a less accurate model of the data. To resolve this mismatch, we introduce the Variational Autoencoder with Learned Latent Structure (VAELLS) which incorporates a learnable manifold model into the latent space of a VAE. This enables us to learn the nonlinear manifold structure from the data and use that structure to define a prior in the latent space. The integration of a latent manifold model not only ensures that our prior is well-matched to the data, but also allows us to define generative transformation paths in the latent space and describe class manifolds with transformations stemming from examples of each class.

A natural way to resolve this problem is to apply online stochastic gradient descent (SGD) so that the per-step time and memory complexity can be reduced to constant with respect to t, but a contextual bandit policy based on online SGD updates that balances exploration and exploitation has remained elusive. In this work, we show that online SGD can be applied to the generalized linear bandit problem.

This paper proposes a novel Bayesian design, SDF-Bayes, for finding the MTD for drug combinations in the presence of safety constraints. Rather than the conventional principle of escalating or de-escalating the current dose of one drug (perhaps alternating between drugs), SDF-Bayes proceeds by cautious optimism: it chooses the next DC that, on the basis of current information, is most likely to be the MTD (optimism), subject to the constraint that it only chooses DCs that have a high probability of being safe (caution).

Ideally, we would like to automatically identify the minimal dimension of the approximation that is sufficient to encode an optimal policy. Towards this end, we consider the problem of model selection in RL with function approximation, given a set of candidate RL algorithms with known regret guarantees. The learner's goal is to adapt to the complexity of the optimal algorithm without knowing it a priori. We present a meta-algorithm that successively rejects increasingly complex models using a simple statistical test. Given at least one candidate that satisfies realizability, we prove the meta-algorithm adapts to the optimal complexity with regret that is only marginally suboptimal in the number of episodes and number of candidate algorithms. The dimension and horizon dependencies remain optimal with respect to the best candidate, and our meta-algorithmic approach is flexible to incorporate multiple candidate algorithms and models.

To understand how wiring topology evolves, we study the underlying mechanism of several leading differentiable NAS frameworks. Our investigation is motivated by three observed searching patterns of differentiable NAS: 1) they search by growing instead of pruning; 2) wider networks are more preferred than deeper ones; 3) no edges are selected in bi-level optimization. To anatomize these phenomena, we propose a unified view on searching algorithms of existing frameworks, transferring the global optimization to local cost minimization. Based on this reformulation, we conduct empirical and theoretical analyses, revealing implicit biases in the cost's assignment mechanism and evolution dynamics that cause the observed phenomena. These biases indicate strong discrimination towards certain topologies. To this end, we pose questions that future differentiable methods for neural wiring discovery need to confront, hoping to evoke a discussion and rethinking on how much bias has been enforced implicitly in existing NAS methods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2021,130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000659893801011,0

First, we find MAML adapts better with a deep architecture even if the tasks need only a shallow one. Secondly, linear layers can be added to the output layers of a shallower model to increase the depth without altering the modelling capacity, leading to improved performance in adaptation. Alternatively, an external and separate neural network meta-optimizer can also be used to transform the gradient updates of a smaller model so as to obtain improved performances in adaptation. Drawing from these evidences, we theorize that for a deep neural network to meta-learn well, the upper layers must transform the gradients of the bottom layers as if the upper layers were an external meta-optimizer, operating on a smaller network that is composed of the bottom layers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2021,130,,,,,,244,+,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000659893800028,0

This general method is instantiated with reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of vector-valued functions as kernel-based projection learning (KPL). For the functional square loss, two closed-form estimators are proposed, one for fully observed output functions and the other for partially observed ones.

Then, in the more general setting of integral losses based on differentiable ground losses, KPL is implemented using first-order optimization for both fully and partially observed output functions. Eventually, several robustness aspects of the proposed algorithms are highlighted on a toy dataset; and a study on two real datasets shows that they are competitive compared to other nonlinear approaches.

Unlike other approaches to feature selection for neural nets, our method uses a modified objective function with constraints, and so integrates feature selection with the parameter learning directly. As a result, it delivers an entire regularization path of solutions with a range of feature sparsity. In experiments with real and simulated data, LassoNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for feature selection and regression.

We then provide a family of convex relaxations to approximate the solution, and a cutting-plane algorithm to improve the relaxations. We derive conditions for the exactness of the relaxations and provide simple closed form formulas for the optimal neural network weights in certain cases. Our results show that the hidden neurons of a ReLU network can be interpreted as convex autoencoders of the input layer. We also establish a connection to l(0)-l(1) equivalence for neural networks analogous to the minimal cardinality solutions in compressed sensing.

In this paper, we propose to address this issue from a parameter space perspective and study an approach to restrict the direction of the gradient updates to avoid forgetting previously-learned data. We present the Orthogonal Gradient Descent (OGD) method, which accomplishes this goal by projecting the gradients from new tasks onto a subspace in which the neural network output on previous task does not change and the projected gradient is still in a useful direction for learning the new task. Our approach utilizes the high capacity of a neural network more efficiently and does not require storing the previously learned data that might raise privacy concerns.

This paper focuses on distributed optimization in the network setting (also known as the decentralized setting), where each agent is only allowed to aggregate information from its neighbors over a graph. By properly adjusting the global gradient estimate via a tracking term, we first develop a communication-efficient approximate Newton-type method, called Network-DANE, which generalizes the attractive DANE algorithm to decentralized networks.

We establish linear convergence of Network-DANE and Network-SVRG for strongly convex losses, and Network-SARAH for quadratic losses, which shed light on the impact of data homogeneity, network connectivity, and local averaging upon the rate of convergence.

To increase statistical power, the so-called multi-task techniques were proposed, which consist in the simultaneous estimation of several related models. Combined with sparsity assumptions, it lead to models enforcing the active regressors to be shared across models, thanks to, for instance l(1)/l(q) norms. We argue in this paper that these techniques fail to leverage the spatial information associated to regressors.

We prove that under mild regularity and curvature conditions, stable support identification is achieved even in the presence of randomized sub-sampled observations (which is the case in compressed sensing or learning scenario). On deconvolution problems, which are translation invariant, this generalizes to the multi-dimensional setting existing results of the literature. For more complex translation-varying problems, such as Laplace transform inversion, this gives the first geometry-aware guarantees for sparse recovery.",,,,,"Keriven, Nicolas/AAR-4705-2020; Keriven, Nicolas/CAF-8143-2022","Keriven, Nicolas/0000-0002-3846-8763",,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2019,89,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000509687901040,0

In this study, we explore whether one iteration of k-means or EM for GMMs can scale sublinearly with C at run-time, while improving the clustering objective remains effective. The tool we apply for complexity reduction is variational EM, which is typically used to make training of generative models with exponentially many hidden states tractable. Here, we apply novel theoretical results on truncated variational EM to make tractable clustering algorithms more efficient. The basic idea is to use a partial variational E-step which reduces the linear complexity of O (NCD) required for a full E-step to a sublinear complexity. Our main observation is that the linear dependency on C can be reduced to a dependency on a much smaller parameter G which relates to cluster neighborhood relations. We focus on two versions of partial variational EM for clustering: variational GMM, scaling with O (NG(2)D), and variational k-means, scaling with O(NGD) per iteration. Empirical results show that these algorithms still require comparable numbers of iterations to improve the clustering objective to same values as k-means. For data with many clusters, we consequently observe reductions of net computational demands between two and three orders of magnitude.

Moreover, building on the work of (Braverman and Mossel, 2009), we show how to efficiently compute the maximum likelihood complete ranking from selective Mallows rankings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2021,130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000659893802073,0

We define a novel regret criterion for estimator design as the difference of the estimation error energies between a clairvoyant estimator that has access to all future observations (a so-called smoother) and a causal one that only has access to current and past observations. The regret-optimal estimator is the causal estimator that minimizes the worst-case regret across all bounded-energy noise sequences. We provide a solution for the regret filtering problem at two levels. First, an horizon-independent solution at the operator level is obtained by reducing the regret to the well-known Nehari problem. Secondly, our main result for state-space models is an explicit estimator that achieves the optimal regret. The regret-optimal estimator is represented as a finite-dimensional state-space whose parameters can be computed by solving three Riccati equations and a single Lyapunov equation.

To build a prediction model in real situations, learning from observational data with a sampling bias is a critical issue due to the lack of randomized controlled trial (RCT) data. To handle such biased observational data, recent efforts in causal inference and counterfactual machine learning have focused on debiased estimation of the potential outcomes on a binary action space and the difference between them, namely, the conditional average treatment effect. When it comes to a large action space (e.g., selecting an appropriate combination of medicines for a patient), however, the regression accuracy of the potential outcomes is no longer sufficient in practical terms to achieve a good decision-making performance. This is because a high mean accuracy on the large action space does not guarantee the nonexistence of a single potential outcome misestimation that misleads the whole decision. Our proposed loss minimizes the classification error of whether or not the action is relatively good for the individual target among all feasible actions, which further improves the decision-making performance, as we demonstrate. We also propose a network architecture and a regularizer that extracts a debiased representation not only from the feature but also from the biased action for better generalization on large action spaces.

Moreover, we extend our results to l(p) (p > 2) certification with spherical symmetric distributions solidifying the limitations of randomized smoothing.

In the former regime, after overcoming the non-smoothness of adversarial training, the adversarial risk of the trained models can converge to the minimal adversarial risk. In the latter regime, we discover that data interpolation prevents the adversarially robust estimator from being consistent.

One general class of algorithms for optimizing interactions with the world, while simultaneously learning how the world operates, is the multi-armed bandit setting and, in particular, the contextual bandit case. In this setting, for each executed action, one observes rewards that are dependent on a given 'context', available at each interaction with the world. The Thompson sampling algorithm has recently been shown to enjoy provable optimality properties for this set of problems, and to perform well in real-world settings. It facilitates generative and interpretable modeling of the problem at hand. Nevertheless, the design and complexity of the model limit its application, since one must both sample from the distributions modeled and calculate their expected rewards. We here show how these limitations can be overcome using variational inference to approximate complex models, applying to the reinforcement learning case advances developed for the inference case in the machine learning community over the past two decades. We consider contextual multi-armed bandit applications where the true reward distribution is unknown and complex, which we approximate with a mixture model whose parameters are inferred via variational inference. We show how the proposed variational Thompson sampling approach is accurate in approximating the true distribution, and attains reduced regrets even with complex reward distributions.

Our core result is a biasvariance decomposition of the generalization error, which shows that the unlabeled-only approach incurs additional bias under misspecification. We then introduce a correction that provably removes this bias in certain cases.

We observe theoretically and with synthetic experiments that for well-specified models, labeled points are worth a constant factor more than unlabeled points.

Using the heat kernel in the GWL framework provides new multiscale graph comparisons without compromising theoretical guarantees, while immediately yielding improved empirical results. A key insight of the GWL framework toward graph partitioning was to compute GW correspondences from a source graph to a template graph with isolated, self-connected nodes.

Under bounded fourth moment assumptions, we show that the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) based on the shrunk data enjoys nearly the minimax optimal rate with an exponential deviation bound. Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed feature shrinkage significantly enhances the statistical performance in linear regression and logistic regression on heavy-tailed data. Finally, we apply our shrinkage principle to guard against mislabeling and image noise in the human-written digit recognition problem. We add an l(4)-norm shrinkage layer to the original neural net and reduce the testing misclassification rate by more than 30% relatively in the presence of mislabeling and image noise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2021,130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000659893803090,0

We then propose a specialized protocol for AUC based on a novel use of hierarchical histograms that achieves MSE of O (alpha(3)/n epsilon(2)) for arbitrary data distribution.

We formulate this problem as an instance of sequential decision-making under uncertainty and leverage methods from reinforcement learning for probabilistic inference with budget constraints. In particular, we propose the TREESAMPLE algorithm, an adaptation of Monte Carlo Tree Search to approximate inference. This algorithm caches all previous queries to the density oracle in an explicit search tree, and dynamically allocates new queries based on a best-first heuristic for exploration, using existing upper confidence bound methods.

We propose a new deep sequential latent variable model for dimensionality reduction and data imputation.

The non-linear dimensionality reduction in the presence of missing data is achieved using a VAE approach with a novel structured variational approximation.

It is known that k-means clustering is highly sensitive to noise, and thus noise should be removed to obtain a quality solution. A popular formulation of this problem is called k-means clustering with outliers. The goal of k-means clustering with outliers is to discard up to a specified number z of points as noise/outliers and then find a k-means solution on the remaining data. The problem has received significant attention, yet current algorithms with theoretical guarantees suffer from either high running time or inherent loss in the solution quality. The main contribution of this paper is two-fold. Firstly, we develop a simple greedy algorithm that has provably strong worst case guarantees. The greedy algorithm adds a simple preprocessing step to remove noise, which can be combined with any k-means clustering algorithm. This algorithm gives the first pseudo-approximation-preserving reduction from k-means with outliers to k-means without outliers. Secondly, we show how to construct a coreset of size O(k log n). When combined with our greedy algorithm, we obtain a scalable, near linear time algorithm. The theoretical contributions are verified experimentally by demonstrating that the algorithm quickly removes noise and obtains a high-quality clustering.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2020,108,,,,,,456,465,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000559931301052,0

Besides average coverage, one might also desire to control conditional coverage, that is, coverage for every new testing point. However, without strong assumptions, conditional coverage is unachievable. Given this limitation, the literature has focused on methods with asymptotical conditional coverage. In order to obtain this property, these methods require strong conditions on the dependence between the target variable and the features. We introduce two conformal methods based on conditional density estimators that do not depend on this type of assumption to obtain asymptotic conditional coverage: Dist-split and CD-split. While Dist-split asymptotically obtains optimal intervals, which are easier to interpret than general regions, CD-split obtains optimal size regions, which are smaller than intervals. CD-split also obtains local coverage by creating prediction bands locally on a partition of the features space. This partition is data-driven and scales to high-dimensional settings. In a wide variety of simulated scenarios, our methods have a better control of conditional coverage and have smaller length than previously proposed methods.",,,,,"Shimizu, Gilson Yuuji/AAA-8325-2022","Shimizu, Gilson Yuuji/0000-0003-3711-5592",,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2020,108,,,,,,3068,3076,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000559931301056,0

The algorithm has one weight vector per class and the surrogate loss is a function of the linear activations (one per class). The surrogate loss of an example with linear activation vector a and class c has the form -log(t1) exp(t2)(a(c) - G(t2)(a)) where the two temperatures t(1) and t(2) temper the log and exp, respectively, and G(t2) (a) is a scalar value that generalizes the log-partition function. We motivate this loss using the Tsallis divergence. Our method allows transitioning between non-convex and convex losses by the choice of the temperature parameters. As the temperature l(1) of the logarithm becomes smaller than the temperature t(2) of the exponential, the surrogate loss becomes quasi convex. Various tunings of the temperatures recover previous methods and tuning the degree of non-convexity is crucial in the experiments. In particular, quasi-convexity and boundedness of the loss provide significant robustness to the outliers. We explain this by showing that t(1) < 1 caps the surrogate loss and t(2) > 1 makes the predictive distribution have a heavy tail. We show that the surrogate loss is Bayes-consistent, even in the non-convex case. Additionally, we provide efficient iterative algorithms for calculating the log-partition value only in a few number of iterations. Our compelling experimental results on large real-world datasets show the advantage of using the two-temperature variant in the noisy as well as the noise free case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2019,89,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000509687902045,0

Label shift naturally arises in many contexts, especially in behavioral studies where the behaviors are freely chosen.

The typical approach to this problem, inverse probability weighted estimation (IPWE) [5], requires logged action probabilities, which may be missing in practice due to engineering complications. Even when available, small action probabilities cause large uncertainty in IPWE, rendering the corresponding results insignificant.

The major difficulty with the resulting infinite-dimensional convex program is the shape constraint on the inverse volatility function. We propose to solve the problem by solving a sequence of finite-dimensional convex programs with increasing dimensions, which can be done globally and efficiently. We demonstrate that, when the goal is to estimate the Sharpe ratio function directly, the finite-sample performance of the proposed estimation method is superior to existing methods that estimate the mean and variance functions separately.

In this paper, we present an empirical evaluation of Bayesian optimization methods in the presence of outliers. The empirical evidence shows that Bayesian optimization with robust regression often produces suboptimal results. We then propose a new algorithm which combines robust regression (a Gaussian process with Student-t likelihood) with outlier diagnostics to classify data points as outliers or inliers.

However, none of them can ensure fairness for each individual without making impractical functional assumptions about the data. In this paper, we propose a far more practical framework for learning an individually fair classifier. To avoid restrictive functional assumptions, we define the probability of individual unfairness (PIU) and solve an optimization problem where PIU's upper bound, which can be estimated from data, is controlled to be close to zero. We elucidate why our method can guarantee fairness for each individual.

We introduce here the first theoretical and experimental analysis of free-rider attacks on federated learning schemes based on iterative parameters aggregation, such as FedAvg or FedProx, and provide formal guarantees for these attacks to converge to the aggregated models of the fair participants. We first show that a straightforward implementation of this attack can be simply achieved by not updating the local parameters during the iterative federated optimization.

The core idea of this framework is to preserve the ranking at the top by matching the order of items of student and teacher, while penalizing large scores for items ranked low by the teacher. Building on this, we develop a novel distillation approach, RankDistil, specifically catered towards ranking problems with a large number of items to rank, and establish statistical basis for the method.

Formulated as unsupervised anomaly detection tasks, an abundance of applications like aviation safety management, the health monitoring of complex infrastructures or fraud detection can now rely on such functional data, acquired and stored with an ever finer granularity. The concept of statistical depth, which reflects centrality of an arbitrary observation w.r.t. a statistical population may play a crucial role in this regard, anomalies corresponding to observations with 'small' depth. Supported by sound theoretical and computational developments in the recent decades, it has proven to be extremely useful, in particular in functional spaces. However, most approaches documented in the literature consist in evaluating independently the centrality of each point forming the time series and consequently exhibit a certain insensitivity to possible shape changes. In this paper, we propose a novel notion of functional depth based on the area of the convex hull of sampled curves, capturing gradual departures from centrality, even beyond the envelope of the data, in a natural fashion. We discuss practical relevance of commonly imposed axioms on functional depths and investigate which of them are satisfied by the notion of depth we promote here.

In this work, we view de-duplication as a clustering problem where the goal is to put records corresponding to the same physical entity in the same cluster and putting records corresponding to different physical entities into different clusters. We introduce a framework which we call promise correlation clustering. Given a complete graph G with the edges labeled 0 and 1, the goal is to find a clustering that minimizes the number of 0 edges within a cluster plus the number of 1 edges across different clusters (or correlation loss). The optimal clustering can also be viewed as a complete graph G* with edges corresponding to points in the same cluster being labeled 0 and other edges being labeled 1. Under the promise that the edge difference between G and G* is small, we prove that finding the optimal clustering (or G*) is still NP-Hard. [Ashtiani et al., 2016] introduced the framework of semi-supervised clustering, where the learning algorithm has access to an oracle, which answers whether two points belong to the same or different clusters. We further prove that even with access to a same-cluster oracle, the promise version is NP-Hard as long as the number queries to the oracle is not too large (o(n) where n is the number of vertices). Given these negative results, we consider a restricted version of correlation clustering. As before, the goal is to find a clustering that minimizes the correlation loss.

The number of labels needed is proportional to the statistical dimension of the problem which is often much smaller than d. Our method is an extension of a joint subsampling procedure called volume sampling. A second major contribution is that we speed up volume sampling so that it is essentially as efficient as leverage scores, which is the main i.i.d. subsampling procedure for this task. Finally, we show theoretically and experimentally that volume sampling has a clear advantage over any i.i.d. sampling when labels are expensive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2018,84,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000509385300076,0

However, the majority of autonomous RL algorithms require a large number of interactions with the environment. A large number of interactions may be impractical in many real-world applications, such as robotics, and many practical systems have to obey limitations in the form of state space or control constraints. To reduce the number of system interactions while simultaneously handling constraints, we propose a model-based RL framework based on probabilistic Model Predictive Control (MPC). In particular, we propose to learn a probabilistic transition model using Gaussian Processes (GPs) to incorporate model uncertainty into long-term predictions, thereby, reducing the impact of model errors. We then use MPC to find a control sequence that minimises the expected long-term cost. We provide theoretical guarantees for first-order optimality in the GP-based transition models with deterministic approximate inference for long-term planning.

In this paper, we make progress in this direction in the context of separated sparsity - a fundamental sparsity notion that captures exclusion constraints in linearly ordered data such as time series. While prior algorithms for computing a projection onto this constraint set required quadratic time, we provide a perturbed Lagrangian relaxation approach that computes provably exact projection in only nearly-linear time.

By looking into two neighboring iterations, in this work, we propose an even simpler variant of the faster alternating least-squares solver. Instead of applying momentum to each update for acceleration, the proposed variant only leverages momentum at every other iteration and can converge at a provably faster linear rate of nearly square-root dependence on the singular value gap of the whitened cross-covariance matrix. In addition to the high consistency between theory and practice, experimental studies also show that our variant of the alternating leastsquares algorithm as a block CCA solver is even more pass efficient than other variants.",,,,,"Xu, Zhiqiang/AAB-7414-2022",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2021,130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000659893801094,0

It is therefore no surprise that optimal transport (OT) metrics and their ability to handle measures with non-overlapping supports have emerged as a promising tool. Yet, training generative machines using OT raises formidable computational and statistical challenges, because of (i) the computational burden of evaluating OT losses, (ii) their instability and lack of smoothness, (iii) the difficulty to estimate them, as well as their gradients, in high dimension. This paper presents the first tractable method to train large scale generative models using an OT-based loss called Sinkhorn loss which tackles these three issues by relying on two key ideas: (a) entropic smoothing, which turns the original OT loss into a differentiable and more robust quantity that can be computed using Sinkhorn fixed point iterations; (b) algorithmic (automatic) differentiation of these iterations with seamless GPU execution. Additionally, Entropic smoothing generates a family of losses interpolating between Wasserstein (OT) and Energy distance/Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) losses, thus allowing to find a sweet spot leveraging the geometry of OT on the one hand, and the favorable high-dimensional sample complexity of MMD, which comes with unbiased gradient estimates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2018,84,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000509385300168,0

We ask: how can one use this additional information in designing model-based GANs?

We prove that several popular probability divergences satisfy some notion of subadditivity under mild conditions.

First, they rely on excessively pessimistic concentration bounds due to the non-linear nature of the model. Second, they require either non-convex projection steps or burn-in phases to enforce boundedness of the estimators. Both of these issues are worsened when considering non-stationary models, in which the GLB parameter may vary with time. In this work, we focus on self-concordant GLB (which include logistic and Poisson regression) with forgetting achieved either by the use of a sliding window or exponential weights. We propose a novel confidence-based algorithm for the maximum-likehood estimator with forgetting and analyze its perfomance in abruptly changing environments. These results as well as the accompanying numerical simulations highlight the potential of the proposed approach to address non-stationarity in GLB.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2021,130,,,,,,658,+,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000659893800074,0

This lack becomes particularly prominent when considering permutation-invariant networks, due to the symmetrical redundancy among the linear regions. To tackle this, we propose a refined definition of piecewise linear function complexity: instead of counting the number of linear regions directly, we first introduce an equivalence relation among the linear functions composing a piecewise linear function and then count those linear functions relative to that equivalence relation.

Existing GP methods are either not scalable to high-dimensional outputs or lack effective strategies to integrate multi-fidelity examples. To address these issues, we propose Multi-Fidelity High-Order Gaussian Process (MFHoGP) that can capture complex correlations both between the outputs and between the fidelities to enhance solution estimation, and scale to large numbers of outputs.

Our estimator takes the form of a weighted kernel estimator with weights that vary adversarially. We prove that our estimator is sharp in that it converges exactly to the tightest bounds possible on CATE when there may be unobserved confounders.

It is often important to predict the long-term evolution of such a time series, and to take the inherent periodicity explicitly into account. In a Gaussian process, periodicity can be accounted for by an appropriate kernel choice. However, the standard periodic kernel does not allow for analytic long-term forecasting. To address this shortcoming, we re-parametrize the periodic kernel, which, in combination with a double approximation, allows for analytic long-term forecasting of a periodic state evolution with Gaussian processes. Our model allows for probabilistic long-term forecasting of periodic processes, which can be valuable in Bayesian decision making, optimal control, reinforcement learning, and robotics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1938-7288,,,,,,2014,33,,,,,,303,311,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000508355800034,0

It is in fact inspired by metallurgy, where the temperature of a material determines its behavior in thermodynamics. Likewise, in simulated annealing, the actions that the algorithm takes depend entirely on the value of a variable which captures the notion of temperature. Typically, simulated annealing starts with a high temperature, which makes the algorithm pretty unpredictable, and gradually cools the temperature down to become more stable. A key component that plays a crucial role in the performance of simulated annealing is the criteria under which the temperature changes, namely, the cooling schedule. Motivated by this, we study the following question in this work: Given enough samples to the instances of a specific class of optimization problems, can we design near-optimal cooling schedules that minimize the runtime or maximize the success rate of the algorithm on average when the underlying problem is drawn uniformly at random from the same class? We provide positive results both in terms of sample complexity and simulation complexity(1). For sample complexity, we show that (O) over tilde(root m) samples suffice to find an approximately optimal cooling schedule of length m. We complement this result by giving a lower bound of (Omega) over tilde (m(1/3)) on the sample complexity of any learning algorithm that provides an almost optimal cooling schedule. These results are general and rely on no assumption. For simulation complexity, however, we make additional assumptions to measure the success rate of an algorithm. To this end, we introduce the monotone stationary graph that models the performance of simulated annealing. Based on this model, we present polynomial time algorithms with provable guarantees for the learning problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2021,130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000659893801085,0

The goal is to minimize regret with respect to the best solution to the k-means objective in hindsight. We show that provided the data lies in a bounded region, learning is possible, namely an implementation of the Multiplicative Weights Update Algorithm (MWUA) using a discretized grid achieves a regret bound of O (root T) in expectation. We also present an online-to-offline reduction that shows that an efficient no-regret online algorithm (despite being allowed to choose a different set of candidate centers at each round) implies an offine efficient algorithm for the k-means problem, which is known to be NP-hard. In light of this hardness, we consider the slightly weaker requirement of comparing regret with respect to (1 + epsilon)OPT and present a no-regret algorithm with runtime O T poly(log(T), k, d, 1/epsilon)(O(kd))). Our algorithm is based on maintaining a set of points of bounded size which is a coreset that helps identifying the relevant regions of the space for running an adaptive, more efficient, variant of the MWUA.

In this paper, we characterize the high accuracy limitation, or the penalty for adaptation, for general adaptive approaches. Specifically, we obtain the first known adaptation lower bound that under a mild condition, any adaptive approach cannot achieve the optimal sample complexity for every 1-Lipschitz property within accuracy epsilon << n(-1/3).

This is because unlike kernel-based distance metrics that require computing the kernel matrix on all pairs of true and synthetic data points, we can detach the data-dependent term from the term solely dependent on synthetic data. Hence, we need to perturb the data-dependent term only once and then use it repeatedly during the generator training. Second, we can obtain an analytic sensitivity of the kernel mean embedding as the random features are norm bounded by construction. This removes the necessity of hyper-parameter search for a clipping norm to handle the unknown sensitivity of a generator network.

Its performance depends strongly on choosing appropriate values for two parameters: the step size used in the simulation, and how long the simulation runs for.

The no-U-turn sampler (NUTS) eliminates this problematic simulation-length parameter, but NUTS's relatively complex control flow makes it difficult to efficiently run many parallel chains on accelerators such as GPUs. NUTS also spends some extra gradient evaluations relative to HMC in order to decide how long to run each iteration without violating detailed balance. We propose ChEES-HMC, a simple adaptive-MCMC scheme for automatically tuning HMC's simulation-length parameter, which minimizes a proxy for the autocorrelation of the state's second moments. We evaluate ChEES-HMC and NUTS on many tasks, and find that ChEES-HMC typically yields larger effective sample sizes per gradient evaluation than NUTS does.

We focus on estimators based on approximate message passing (AMP), a family of iterative algorithms with many appealing features: the performance of AMP in the high-dimensional limit can be succinctly characterized under suitable model assumptions; AMP can also be tailored to the empirical distribution of the signal entries, and for a wide class of estimation problems, AMP is conjectured to be optimal among all polynomial-time algorithms. However, a major issue of AMP is that in many models (such as phase retrieval), it requires an initialization correlated with the ground-truth signal and independent from the measurement matrix. Assuming that such an initialization is available is typically not realistic. In this paper, we solve this problem by proposing an AMP algorithm initialized with a spectral estimator. With such an initialization, the standard AMP analysis fails since the spectral estimator depends in a complicated way on the design matrix. Our main contribution is a rigorous characterization of the performance of AMP with spectral initialization in the high-dimensional limit. The key technical idea is to define and analyze a two-phase artificial AMP algorithm that first produces the spectral estimator, and then closely approximates the iterates of the true AMP.

This bound is attained via differentially private gradient descent (DP-GD). Furthermore, via the first lower bound for unconstrained private ERM, we show that our upper bound is tight. In sharp contrast to the constrained ERM setting, there is no dependence on the dimensionality of the ambient model space (p). (Notice that rank <= min{n, p}. Besides, we obtain an analogous excess population risk bound which depends on rank instead of p.

The basic idea of SI is to make inference conditional on the selection event. Unfortunately, the main limitation of the original SI approach for Lasso is that the inference is conducted not only conditional on the selected features but also on their signs - this leads to loss of power because of over-conditioning. Although this limitation can be circumvented by considering the union of such selection events for all possible combinations of signs, this is only feasible when the number of selected features is sufficiently small. To address this computational bottleneck, we propose a parametric programming-based method that can conduct SI without conditioning on signs even when we have thousands of active features. The main idea is to compute the continuum path of Lasso solutions in the direction of the selected test statistic, and identify the subset of the data space corresponding to the feature selection event by following the solution path.

Our contribution consists of a new (1) decomposable compact representation of the problem; (2) dual block-coordinate ascent method for optimizing the decomposition-based dual; and (3) primal heuristics that reconstructs a feasible integer solution based on the dual information.

Though bagging is now widely used in practice and many empirical studies have explored its behavior, we still know little about the theoretical properties of bagged predictions. In this paper, we theoretically investigate how the bagging method can reduce the Mean Squared Error (MSE) when applied on a statistical estimator. First, we prove that for any estimator, increasing the number of bagged estimators N in the average can only reduce the MSE. This intuitive result, observed empirically and discussed in the literature, has not yet been rigorously proved. Second, we focus on the standard estimator of variance called unbiased sample variance and we develop an exact analytical expression of the MSE for this estimator with bagging. This allows us to rigorously discuss the number of iterations N and the batch size m of the bagging method. From this expression, we state that only if the kurtosis of the distribution is greater than 3/2, the MSE of the variance estimator can be reduced with bagging. This result is important because it demonstrates that for distribution with low kurtosis, bagging can only deteriorate the performance of a statistical prediction. Finally, we propose a novel general-purpose algorithm to estimate with high precision the variance of a sample.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2020,108,,,,,,288,296,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000559931302043,0

Choosing between different meta-learners in a data-driven manner is difficult, as it requires access to counterfactual information. Therefore, with the ultimate goal of building better understanding of the conditions under which some learners can be expected to perform better than others a priori, we theoretically analyze four broad meta-learning strategies which rely on plug-in estimation and pseudo-outcome regression. We highlight how this theoretical reasoning can be used to guide principled algorithm design and translate our analyses into practice by considering a variety of neural network architectures as base-learners for the discussed metalearning strategies.

Due to the crucial tuning parameter gamma in the Gaussian kernel, the design of effective quantization schemes for RFF appears to be challenging. Intuitively one would expect that a different quantizer is needed for a different gamma value (and we need to store a different set of quantized data for each gamma). Interestingly, the recent work (Li and Li, 2021) showed that only one Lloyd-Max (LM) quantizer is needed by showing that the marginal distribution of RFF is free of the tuning parameter gamma. On the other hand, Li and Li (2021) still required to store a different set of quantized data for each gamma value. In this paper, we adopt the one-sketch-forall paradigm for quantizing RFFs. Basically, we only store one set of quantized linear sketches after applying random projections on the original data. From the same set of quantized data, we construct RFFs to approximate Gaussian kernels for any tuning parameter gamma.

In this work, we explore a complementary approach to variance reduction based on two classical Monte Carlo swindles: first, running an auxiliary coupled chain targeting a tractable approximation to the target distribution, and using the auxiliary samples as control variates; and second, generating anti-correlated (antithetic) samples by running two chains with flipped randomness.

In this work, we address these questions by using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) as an example. As expected, we find that the fine-tuned models are close in parameter space to the pre-trained one, with the closeness varying from layer to layer. We show that it suffices to fine-tune only the most critical layers. Further, we find that there are surprisingly many good solutions in the set of sparsified versions of the pre-trained model.

In this paper, we introduce a new weak oracle model, where a non-malicious user responds to a pairwise comparison query only when she is quite sure about the answer. This model is able to mimic the behavior of a human in noise-prone regions.

In this study, we provide a theoretical answer (validated by experiments) that MinHash virtually always outperforms SimHash when the data are binary, as common in practice such as search. The collision probability of MinHash is a function of resemblance similarity (R,), while the collision probability of SimHash is a function of cosine similarity (S). To provide a common basis for comparison, we evaluate retrieval results in terms of S for both MinHash and SimHash. This evaluation is valid as we can prove that MinHash is a valid LSH with respect to S, by using a general inequality S-2 < R <= S/2-S. Our worst case analysis can show that MinHash significantly outperforms SimHash in high similarity region. Interestingly, our intensive experiments reveal that MinHash is also substantially better than SimHash even in datasets where most of the data points are not too similar to each other. This is partly because, in practical data, often R >= s/z-s holds where z is only slightly larger than 2 (e.g., z < 2.1). Our restricted worst case analysis by assuming s/z-s <= R <= S/2-S shows that MinHash indeed significantly outperforms SimHash even in low similarity region.

To overcome these downsides, we propose a spectral clustering algorithm based on a complex-valued matrix representation of digraphs.

Therefore, optimal transport (OT) can only be used in machine learning if it is substantially regularized. On the other hand, one of the greatest achievements of the OT literature in recent years lies in regularity theory: Caffarelli (2000) showed that the OT map between two well behaved measures is Lipschitz, or equivalently when considering 2-Wasserstein distances, that Brenier convex potentials (whose gradient yields an optimal map) are smooth. We propose in this work to draw inspiration from this theory and use regularity as a regularization tool. We give algorithms operating on two discrete measures that can recover nearly optimal transport maps with small distortion, or equivalently, nearly optimal Brenier potentials that are strongly convex and smooth. The problem boils down to solving alternatively a convex QCQP and a discrete OT problem, granting access to the values and gradients of the Brenier potential not only on sampled points, but also out of sample at the cost of solving a simpler QCQP for each evaluation.

We approximate the true label noise by a model that learns the aspects of the noise that are class-conditional (i.e., independent of the input given the observed label). To select labels for correction, we adopt the active learning strategy of maximizing the expected model change. We consider the change in regularized empirical risk functionals that use different pointwise loss functions for patterns with noisy and true labels, respectively. Different loss functions for the noisy data lead to different active label correction algorithms. If loss functions consider the label noise rates, these rates are estimated during learning, where importance weighting compensates for the sampling bias. We show empirically that viewing the true label as a latent variable and computing the maximum likelihood estimate of the model parameters performs well across all considered problems.

The estimators that we study are not new, and have been widely used for variance component estimation in linear random-effects models. However, our analysis is new and it implies that the MLEs, which were devised for random-effects models, may also perform very well in high-dimensional linear models with fixed-effects, which are more commonly studied in some areas of high-dimensional statistics. The MLEs are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal in fixed-effects models with random design, in asymptotic settings where the number of predictors (p) is proportional to the number of observations (n). Moreover, the estimators' asymptotic variance can be given explicitly in terms moments of the Marcenko-Pastur distribution. A variety of analytical and empirical results show that the MLEs outperform other, previously proposed estimators for variance parameters in high-dimensional linear models with fixed-effects.

Our approach is based on the following key result that we prove in the paper: if an MLN has no shared terms then MAP inference over it can be reduced to MAP inference over a Markov network having the following properties: (i) the number of random variables in the Markov network is equal to the number of first-order atoms in the MLN; and (ii) the domain size of each variable in the Markov network is equal to the number of groundings of the corresponding first-order atom. We show that inference over this Markov network is exponentially more efficient than ground inference, namely inference over the Markov network obtained by grounding all first-order atoms in the MLN. We improve this result further by showing that if non-shared MLNs contain no self joins, namely every atom appears at most once in each of its formulas, then all variables in the corresponding Markov network need only be bi-valued. Our approach is quite general and can be easily applied to an arbitrary MLN by simply grounding all of its shared terms. The key feature of our approach is that because we reduce lifted inference to propositional inference, we can use any propositional MAP inference algorithm for performing lifted MAP inference. Within our approach, we experimented with two propositional MAP inference algorithms: Gurobi and MaxWalkSAT.

In this work, we show that the bound based on the oracle prior can be suboptimal: In some cases, a stronger bound is obtained by using a data-dependent oracle prior, i.e., a conditional expectation of the posterior, given a subset of the training data that is then excluded from the empirical risk term. While using data to learn a prior is a known heuristic, its essential role in optimal bounds is new. In fact, we show that using data can mean the difference between vacuous and nonvacuous bounds.

On the other hand, recent results show that training with SGD can result in heavy-tailedness in the distribution of the network weights with a potentially infinite variance. This suggests that the traditional approach to initialization may be restrictive as SGD updates do not necessarily preserve the finiteness of the variance of layer outputs. Motivated by this, we develop initialization schemes for fully connected feed-forward networks that can provably preserve any given moment of order s is an element of (0, 2] over the layers for a class of activations including ReLU, Leaky ReLU, Randomized Leaky ReLU and linear activations. These generalized schemes recover traditional initialization schemes in the limit s -> 2 and serve as part of a principled theory for initialization. For all these schemes, we show that the network output admits a finite almost sure limit as the number of layers grows, and the limit is heavy-tailed in some settings. We also prove that the logarithm of the norm of the network outputs, if properly scaled, will converge to a Gaussian distribution with an explicit mean and variance we can compute depending on the activation used, the value of s chosen and the network width, where log-normality serves as a further justification of why the norm of the network output can be heavy-tailed in DNNs. We also prove that our initialization scheme avoids small network output values more frequently compared to traditional approaches. Our results extend if dropout is used and the proposed initialization strategy does not have an extra cost during the training procedure. Finally, we discuss extensions of our results to convolutional neural networks and show through numerical experiments that our initialization can improve the initial stages of training.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2021,130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000659893802068,0

An important aspect of this is evaluating how robust a model is to changes in setting or population, which typically requires applying the model to multiple, independent datasets. Since the cost of collecting such datasets is often prohibitive, in this paper, we propose a framework for analyzing this type of stability using the available data. We use the original evaluation data to determine distributions under which the algorithm performs poorly, and estimate the algorithm's performance on the worst-case distribution. We consider shifts in user defined conditional distributions, allowing some distributions to shift while keeping other portions of the data distribution fixed. For example, in a healthcare context, this allows us to consider shifts in clinical practice while keeping the patient population fixed. To address the challenges associated with estimation in complex, high-dimensional distributions, we derive a debiased estimator which maintains root N-consistency even when machine learning methods with slower convergence rates are used to estimate the nuisance parameters. In experiments on a real medical risk prediction task, we show this estimator can be used to analyze stability and accounts for realistic shifts that could not previously be expressed.

This is possible because the posterior expectation of Gaussian process regression maps a finite set of samples to a function defined on the whole real line, expressed as a linear combination of covariance functions. We estimate the covariance function from the data using an appropriately designed gradient ascent method that constrains the solution to a linear combination of tractable kernel functions.

For instance, in the case of data set augmentation, the posterior is conditioned on artificial data and not on what is actually observed. In this paper, we address the problem of how to specify an informative prior when the problem of interest is known to exhibit invariance properties. The proposed method is akin to posterior variational inference: we choose a parametric family and optimize to find the member of the family that makes the model robust to a given transformation.

However, in practice we usually do not know the true rank, and, in any event, from a computational and statistical standpoint it is likely to be prohibitively large. It is therefore of great practical interest to understand the behavior of low-rank spectral learning, where the model rank is less than the true rank. Counterintuitively, we show that even when the singular values omitted by lowering the rank are arbitrarily small, the resulting prediction errors can in fact be arbitrarily large. We identify two distinct possible causes for this bad behavior, and illustrate them with simple examples. We then show that these two causes are essentially complete: assuming that they do not occur, we can prove that the prediction error is bounded in terms of the magnitudes of the omitted singular values.

Recently, Haussmann et al [10] tackled the MIL instance label prediction task by introducing the Multiple Instance Learning Gaussian Process Logistic (MIL-GP-Logistic) model, an adaptation of the Gaussian Process Logistic Classification model that inherits its uncertainty quantification and flexibility. Notably, they give a fast mean-field variational inference procedure. However, due to their use of the logit link, they do not maximize the variational inference ELBO objective directly, but rather a lower bound on it. This approximation, as we show, hurts predictive performance. In this work, we propose the Multiple Instance Learning Gaussian Process Probit (MIL-GP-Probit) model, an adaptation of the Gaussian Process Probit Classification model to solve the MIL instance label prediction problem. Leveraging the analytical tractability of the probit link, we give a variational inference procedure based on variable augmentation that maximizes the ELBO objective directly. Applying it, we show MIL-GP-Probit is more calibrated than MIL-GP-Logistic on all 20 datasets of the benchmark 20 Newsgroups dataset collection, and achieves higher AUC than MIL-GP-Logistic on an additional 51 out of 59 datasets. Finally, we show how the probit formulation enables principled bag label predictions and a Gibbs sampling scheme. This is the first exact inference scheme for any Bayesian model for the MIL scenario.

(b) how does the rate of margin convergence depend on the tail of the loss function and the choice of the step size? We show that for a large family of super-polynomial tailed losses, gradient descent iterates on linear networks of any depth converge in the direction of L-2 maximum-margin solution, while this does not hold for losses with heavier tails. Within this family, for simple linear models we show that the optimal rates with fixed step size is indeed obtained for the commonly used exponentially tailed losses such as logistic loss.

The duality gap measures the degree of intrinsic non-convexity of an optimization problem: smaller gap in relative value implies lower degree of intrinsic non-convexity. The challenge is to quantitatively measure the duality gap of highly non-convex problems such as deep neural networks. In this work, we provide strong guarantees of this quantity for two classes of network architectures. For the neural networks with arbitrary activation functions, multi-branch architecture and a variant of hinge loss, we show that the duality gap of both population and empirical risks shrinks to zero as the number of branches increases. This result sheds light on better understanding the power of over-parametrization where increasing the number of branches tends to make the loss surface less non-convex.

To do this, we follow a hierarchical approach, where we first learn the parameters that are to be tied using a non-relational learner. We then use a relational learner to learn the tied-parameter MLN with initial values derived from parameters learned by the non-relational learner.

To overcome this drawback, we propose a Bayesian procedure that allows to obtain several sparse components with the same sparsity pattern.

The exact marginal likelihood can eventually be maximized over this path, relying on Occam's razor to select the relevant variables.

We pose USS as a version of stochastic partial monitoring problem with an unusual reward structure (even noisy annotations are unavailable). Unsurprisingly no learner can achieve sublinear regret without further assumptions. To this end we propose the notion of weak-dominance. This is a condition on the joint probability distribution of test outputs and latent state and says that whenever a test is accurate on an example, a later test in the sequence is likely to be accurate as well. We empirically verify that weak dominance holds on real datasets and prove that it is a maximal condition for achieving sublinear regret.

We prove that this flexible topic model class can be learnt via spectral methods using only moments up to the third order, with (low order) polynomial sample and computational complexity.

In our model, there are L observed contexts and K arms of the bandit. The observed context influences the reward obtained through a latent confounder variable with cardinality m (m << L,K). The arm choice and the latent confounder causally determines the reward while the observed context is correlated with the confounder. Under this model, the L x K mean reward matrix U (for each context in [L] and each arm in [K]) factorizes into non-negative factors A (L x m) and W (m x K). This insight enables us to propose an epsilon-greedy NMF-Bandit algorithm that designs a sequence of interventions (selecting specific arms), that achieves a balance between learning this low-dimensional structure and selecting the best arm to minimize regret. Our algorithm achieves a regret of O (Lpoly(m, log K) log T) at time T, as compared to O(LK log T) for conventional contextual bandits, assuming a constant gap between the best arm and the rest for each context. These guarantees are obtained under mild sufficiency conditions on the factors that are weaker versions of the well-known Statistical RIP condition. We further propose a class of generative models that satisfy our sufficient conditions, and derive a lower bound of O (Km log T). These are the first regret guarantees for online matrix completion with bandit feedback, when the rank is greater than one.

In some cases, the true clusters exhibit a known size distribution; in image segmentation, for instance, human-segmented images tend to yield segment sizes that follow a power-law distribution.

We further show that near-optimal rates are attainable by estimators tuned from data alone, i.e. with no prior distributional information.

Yet for problems involving large output domains (i.e., the state space for each variable is large), standard LP relaxations can easily give rise to a large number of variables and constraints which are beyond the limit of existing optimization algorithms. In this paper, we introduce an effective MAP inference method for problems with large output domains. The method builds upon alternating minimization of an Augmented Lagrangian that exploits the sparsity of messages through greedy optimization techniques. A key feature of our greedy approach is to introduce variables in an on-demand manner with a pre-built data structure over local factors. This results in a single-loop algorithm of sublinear cost per iteration and O(log(1/epsilon))-type iteration complexity to achieve epsilon sub-optimality. In addition, we introduce a variant of GDMM for binary MAP inference problems with a large number of factors.

Although there exist a large number of similarity measures between distributions, very little is known about their generalization performance in specific learning tasks. Learning problems formulated on distributions have an inherent two-stage sampled difficulty: in practice only samples from sampled distributions are observable, and one has to build an estimate on similarities computed between sets of points. To the best of our knowledge, the only existing method with consistency guarantees for distribution regression requires kernel density estimation as an intermediate step (which suffers from slow convergence issues in high dimensions), and the domain of the distributions to be compact Euclidean. In this paper, we provide theoretical guarantees for a remarkably simple algorithmic alternative to solve the distribution regression problem: embed the distributions to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and learn a ridge regressor from the embeddings to the outputs. Our main contribution is to prove the consistency of this technique in the two-stage sampled setting under mild conditions (on separable, topological domains endowed with kernels). For a given total number of observations, we derive convergence rates as an explicit function of the problem difficulty.

A fundamental question is how the computational savings trade off against the statistical error incurred due to approximations. This paper develops general results that address this question. We bound the Wasserstein distance between the equilibrium distributions of two diffusions as a function of their mixing rates and the deviation in their drifts. We show that this error bound is tight in simple Gaussian settings. Our general result on continuous diffusions can be discretized to provide insights into the computational{statistical trade-off of Markov chains. As an illustration, we apply our framework to derive finite-sample error bounds of approximate unadjusted Langevin dynamics. We characterize computation-constrained settings where, by using fast-to-compute approximate gradients in the Langevin dynamics, we obtain more accurate samples compared to using the exact gradients.

Recently, various norms [1, 2] were proposed, which can be best described as instances of ordered weighted l(1) norms (OWL) [3], as an alternative to l(1) regularization used in LASSO. OWL can identify groups of correlated variables but it forces the model to be constant within a group. This artifact induces unnecessary bias in the model estimation. In this paper we take a submodular perspective and show that OWL can be posed as the Lovasz extension of a suitably defined submodular function. The submodular perspective not only explains the group-wise constant behavior of OWL, but also suggests alternatives. The main contribution of this paper is smoothed OWL (SOWL), a new family of norms, which not only identifies the groups but also allows the model to be flexible inside a group. We establish several algorithmic and theoretical properties of SOWL including group identification and model consistency. We also provide algorithmic tools to compute the SOWL norm and its proximal operator, whose computational complexity O(d log d) is significantly better than that of general purpose solvers in O(d(2) log d).

Experiments conducted on rating datasets from a wide variety of domains, e.g., movie, books and electronics, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher performance for predicting cross-domain ratings than existing methods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1938-7288,,,,,,2015,38,,,,,,379,387,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000508399700042,0

Recently, subspace constrained mean shift (SCMS) was proposed as a practical algorithm for density ridge estimation. A key technical ingredient in SCMS is to accurately estimate the ratios of the density derivatives to the density. SCMS takes a three-step approach for this purpose - first estimating the data density, then computing its derivatives, and finally taking their ratios. However, this three-step approach can be unreliable because a good density estimator does not necessarily mean a good density derivative estimator and division by an estimated density could significantly magnify the estimation error. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel method that directly estimates the ratios without going through density estimation and division. Our proposed estimator has an analytic-form solution and it can be computed efficiently. We further establish a non-parametric convergence bound for the proposed ratio estimator.

We consider a limiting case of generalized linear modeling when the target variables are only known up to permutation, and explore how this relates to permutation testing; a standard technique for assessing statistical dependency. Based on this relationship, we propose a simple algorithm to estimate the model parameters and individual level inferences via alternating imputation and standard generalized linear model fitting.

The framework is extended to general histogram data with larger bins - with order statistics such as the median as a limiting case.

However, it is well-established that in the high-dimensional setting (p > N) the underlying projection estimator degenerates. Moreover, any linear discriminate function involving a large number of features may be difficult to interpret. To ameliorate these issues, two general categories of sparse LDA modifications have been proposed, both to reduce the number of active features and to stabilize the resulting projections. The first, based on optimal scoring, is more straightforward to implement and analyze but has been heavily criticized for its ambiguous connection with the original LDA formulation. In contrast, a second strategy applies sparse penalty functions directly to the original LDA objective but requires additional heuristic trade-off parameters, has unknown global and local minima properties, and requires a greedy sequential optimization procedure. In all cases the choice of sparse regularizer can be important, but no rigorous guidelines have been provided regarding which penalty might be preferable. Against this backdrop, we winnow down the broad space of candidate sparse LDA algorithms and promote a specific selection based on optimal scoring coupled with a particular, complementary sparse regularizer.

Gradient boosting, which is used to automatically induce and select feature functions, is a natural candidate solution to the problem. However, it is non-trivial to derive gradient boosting algorithms for CRFs due to the dense Hessian matrices introduced by variable dependencies. Existing approaches thus use only first-order information when optimizing likelihood, and hence face convergence issues. We incorporate second-order information by deriving a Markov Chain mixing rate bound to quantify the dependencies, and introduce a gradient boosting algorithm that iteratively optimizes an adaptive upper bound of the objective function. The resulting algorithm induces and selects features for CRFs via functional space optimization, with provable convergence guarantees. Experimental results on three real world datasets demonstrate that the mixing rate based upper bound is effective for learning CRFs with non-linear potentials.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1938-7288,,,,,,2015,38,,,,,,147,155,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000508399700017,0

While logistic calibration is designed for normally distributed per-class scores, we demonstrate experimentally that many classifiers including Naive Bayes and Adaboost suffer from a particular distortion where these score distributions are heavily skewed. In such cases logistic calibration can easily yield probability estimates that are worse than the original scores. Moreover, the logistic curve family does not include the identity function, and hence logistic calibration can easily uncalibrate a perfectly calibrated classifier.

In order to accurately predict choice decisions involving preference reversals, which existing econometric methods have failed to incorporate, the authors introduce a new cognitive choice model whose parameters are efficiently fitted with a global convex optimization algorithm. The proposed model captures each human as a Bayesian decision maker facing a mental conflict between objective evaluation samples and a subjective prior, where the underlying objective evaluation function is rationally independent from contexts while the subjective prior is irrationally determined by each choice set. As the key idea to analytically handle the irrationality and to yield the convex optimization, the Bayesian decision mechanism is implemented as a closed-form Gaussian process regression using similarities among the available options in each context.

Our first result shows that such networks are properly learnable in poly(n, d, exp(1/epsilon(2))) time, where n and d are the sample size and the input dimension, and epsilon > 0 is the gap to optimality. The bound is achieved by repeatedly sampling over a low-dimensional manifold so as to ensure approximate optimality, but avoids the exp(d) cost of exhaustively searching over the parameter space. We also establish a hardness result showing that the exponential dependence on 1/epsilon is unavoidable unless RP = NP. Our second result shows that the exponential dependence on 1/epsilon can be avoided by exploiting the underlying structure of the data distribution. In particular, if the positive and negative examples can be separated with margin gamma > 0 by an unknown neural network, then the network can be learned in poly(n, d, 1/epsilon) time.

For learning a mixture of k axisaligned Gaussians in d dimensions, we give an algorithm that outputs a mixture of O(k/epsilon(3)) Gaussians that is epsilon-close in statistical distance to the true distribution, without any separation assumptions. The time and sample complexity is roughly O(kd/epsilon(3))(d). This is polynomial when d is constant precisely the regime in which known methods fail to identify the components efficiently. Given that non-negativity is a natural assumption, we believe that our result may find use in other settings in which we wish to approximately explain data using a small number of a (large) candidate set of components.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1938-7288,,,,,,2015,38,,,,,,83,92,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000508399700010,0

To overcome these limitations, we introduce a conceptual separation between learning, used to infer attacker preferences, and operational decisions, which account for adversarial evasion, enforce operational constraints, and naturally admit randomization. Our approach gives rise to an intractably large linear program. To overcome scalability limitations, we introduce a novel method for estimating a compact parity basis representation for the operational decision function.

Both types of generalization are commonly used in the literature. For instance, generalization in expectation has been used to analyze algorithms, such as ridge regression and SGD, whereas generalization in probability is used in the VC theory, among others. Recently, a third notion of generalization has been studied, called uniform generalization, which requires that the generalization risk vanishes uniformly in expectation across all bounded parametric losses. It has been shown that uniform generalization is, in fact, equivalent to an information-theoretic stability constraint, and that it recovers classical results in learning theory. It is achievable under various settings, such as sample compression schemes, finite hypothesis spaces, finite domains, and differential privacy. However, the relationship between uniform generalization and concentration remained unknown. In this paper, we answer this question by proving that, while a generalization in expectation does not imply a generalization in probability, a uniform generalization in expectation does imply concentration. We establish a chain rule for the uniform generalization risk of the composition of hypotheses and use it to derive a large deviation bound.

We formulate the problem of learning these functions as a constrained variational maximum likelihood estimation problem with total variation penalty and show that the optimal solution is a 0th order spline (a piecewise constant function) with a finite number of adaptively chosen knots. This allows the inference problem to be solved efficiently and at scale by solving a finite dimensional optimization problem.

In this paper, formalize a new class of multi-armed bandit methods, Global Multi-armed Bandit (GMAB), in which arms are globally informative through a global parameter, i.e., choosing an arm reveals information about all the arms. We propose a greedy policy for the GMAB which always selects the arm with the highest estimated expected reward, and prove that it achieves bounded parameter-dependent regret. Hence, this policy selects suboptimal arms only finitely many times, and after a finite number of initial time steps, the optimal arm is selected in all of the remaining time steps with probability one.

Here, we introduce and analyse a pre-adversarial model, in which adversarial modifications come before the noise. Given an input coming from such a semi-adversarial generative model, the goal is to approximately reconstruct with high probability the latent clustering. We focus on the case where the hidden clusters have nearly equal size and show the following. In the pre-adversarial setting, spectral algorithms are optimal, in the sense that they reconstruct all the way to the information-theoretic threshold beyond which no reconstruction is possible. This is in contrast to the post-adversarial setting, in which their ability to restore the hidden clusters stops before the threshold, but the gap is optimally filled by SDP-based algorithms.

The key technical challenge is how to control the switching cost, the cumulative movements of player's decisions, which is neatly addressed by a novel decomposition of dynamic policy regret and a careful design of meta-learner and base-learner that explicitly regularizes the switching cost. The results are further applied to tackle non-stationarity in online non-stochastic control [Agarwal et al., 2019], i.e., controlling a linear dynamical system with adversarial disturbance and convex cost functions. We derive a novel gradient-based controller with dynamic policy regret guarantees, which is the first controller provably competitive to a sequence of changing policies for online non-stochastic control.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2022,151,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000828072702007,0

Our goal is to automatically adapt to the instance-dependent complexity measure of the smallest hypothesis class containing the true model, rather than suffering from the complexity measure related to the largest hypothesis class. We provide evidence showing that a standard doubling trick over dimension fails to achieve the optimal instance-dependent sample complexity. Our algorithms define a new optimization problem based on experimental design that leverages the geometry of the action set to efficiently identify a near-optimal hypothesis class. Our fixed budget algorithm uses a novel application of a selection-validation trick in bandits. This provides a new method for the understudied fixed budget setting in linear bandits (even without the added challenge of model selection).

We conjecture that our upper bounds are also optimal in scenario (iii) (there is no known lower bound in this setting). Existing online algorithms proceed in epochs of (typically exponentially) growing durations. The control policy is fixed within each epoch, which considerably simplifies the analysis of the estimation error on A and B and hence of the regret. Our algorithm departs from this design choice: it is a simple variant of certainty-equivalence regulators, where the estimates of A and B and the resulting control policy can be updated as frequently as we wish, possibly at every step. Quantifying the impact of such a constantly-varying control policy on the performance of these estimates and on the regret constitutes one of the technical challenges tackled in this paper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2022,151,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000841852304034,0

Such data can be profoundly useful for understanding trends within a given population, but also pose a significant privacy risk, potentially revealing e.g., who spends time where. Producing a private version of a time-series satisfying the standard definition of Differential Privacy (DP) is challenging due to the large influence a single participant can have on the sequence: if an individual can contribute to each time step, the amount of additive noise needed to satisfy privacy increases linearly with the number of time steps sampled. As such, if a signal spans a long duration or is oversampled, an excessive amount of noise must be added, drowning out underlying trends. However, in many applications an individual realistically cannot participate at every time step. When this is the case, we observe that the influence of a single participant (sensitivity) can be reduced by subsampling and/or filtering in time, while still meeting privacy requirements.

This method, invariant causal prediction (ICP), has a substantial computational defect - the runtime scales exponentially with the number of possible causal variables. In this work, we show that the approach taken in ICP may be reformulated as a series of nonparametric tests that scales linearly in the number of predictors. Each of these tests relies on the minimization of a novel loss function - the Wasserstein variance - that is derived from tools in optimal transport theory and is used to quantify distributional variability across environments.

One of the most crucial aspects is the landscape at random initialization, which often influences convergence speed dramatically. In their seminal works, Xavier & Bengio, 2010 and He et al., 2015 propose an initialization strategy that is supposed to prevent gradients from vanishing. Yet, we identify shortcomings of their expectation analysis as network depth increases, and show that the proposed initialization can actually fail to deliver stable gradient norms. More precisely, by leveraging an in-depth analysis of the median of the forward pass, we first show that, with high probability, vanishing gradients cannot be circumvented when the network width scales with less than Omega(depth). Second, we extend this analysis to second-order derivatives and show that random i.i.d. initialization also gives rise to Hessian matrices with eigenspectra that vanish in depth. Whenever this happens, optimizers are initialized in a very flat, saddle pointlike plateau, which is particularly hard to escape with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as its escaping time is inversely related to curvature magnitudes. We believe that this observation is crucial for fully understanding (a) the historical difficulties of training deep nets with vanilla SGD and (b) the success of adaptive gradient methods, which naturally adapt to curvature and thus quickly escape flat plateaus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2022,151,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000841852302016,0

The learning process is, however, usually uninformed of these symmetries. Therefore, the learned representations for individually transformed inputs may not be meaningfully related. In this paper, we propose an SO(3) equivariant deep dynamical model (EqDDM) for motion prediction that learns a structured representation of the input space in the sense that the embedding varies with symmetry transformations.

In the context of how the brain learns, one aspect of gradient descent that appears biologically difficult to realize (if not implausible) is that its updates rely on feedback from later layers to earlier layers through the same connections. Such bidirected links are relatively few in brain networks, and even when reciprocal connections exist, they may not be equi-weighted. Random Feedback Alignment (Lillicrap et al., 2016), where the backward weights are random and fixed, has been proposed as a bio-plausible alternative and found to be effective empirically. We investigate how and when feedback alignment (FA) works, focusing on one of the most basic problems with layered structure - low-rank matrix factorization. In this problem, given a matrix Y-nxm, the goal is to find a low rank factorization Z(nxr)W(rxm) that minimizes the error parallel to ZW - Y parallel to(F). Gradient descent solves this problem optimally. We show that FA finds the optimal solution when r >= rank(Y). We also shed light on how FA works. It is observed empirically that the forward weight matrices and (random) feedback matrices come closer during FA updates. Our analysis rigorously derives this phenomenon and shows how it facilitates convergence of FA*, a closely related variant of FA. We also show that FA can be far from optimal when r < rank(Y). This is the first provable separation result between gradient descent and FA. Moreover, the representations found by gradient descent and FA can be almost orthogonal even when their error parallel to ZW - Y parallel to(F) is approximately equal. As a corollary, these results also hold for training two-layer linear neural networks when the training input is isotropic, and the output is a linear function of the input.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2022,151,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000828072704007,0

There are two very different schools of thought that have tackled this problem. On the one hand, the Pearlian framework commonly assumes structural knowledge (provided by an expert) in the form of directed acyclic graphs and provides graphical criteria such as the back-door criterion to identify the valid adjustment sets. On the other hand, the potential outcomes (PO) framework commonly assumes that all the observed features satisfy ignorability (i.e., no hidden confounding), which in general is untestable. In prior works that attempted to bridge these frameworks, there is an observational criteria to identify an anchor variable and if a subset of covariates (not involving the anchor variable) passes a suitable conditional independence criteria, then that subset is a valid back-door. Our main result strengthens these prior results by showing that under a different expert-driven structural knowledge - that one variable is a direct causal parent of the treatment variable - remarkably, testing for subsets (not involving the known parent variable) that are valid back-doors is equivalent to an invariance test. Importantly, we also cover the non-trivial case where the entire set of observed features is not ignorable (generalizing the PO framework) without requiring the knowledge of all the parents of the treatment variable. Our key technical idea involves generation of a synthetic sub-sampling (or environment) variable that is a function of the known parent variable. In addition to designing an invariance test, this sub-sampling variable allows us to leverage Invariant Risk Minimization, and thus, connects finding valid adjustments (in non-ignorable observational settings) to representation learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness and tradeoffs of these approaches on a variety of synthetic datasets as well as real causal effect estimation benchmarks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2022,151,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000828072705025,0

The case of divergences defined by superlinear functions was recently studied by Di Marino and Gerolin.

In state-space models, such a latent structure adapted mean-field approximation can be efficiently computed using the belief propagation algorithm. Theoretically, we show that this adapted mean-field approximation leads to consistent variational estimates. Furthermore, we derive a non-asymptotic risk bound for an averaged a-divergence from the true data generating model, suggesting that the posterior mean of the best variational approximation for the static parameters shows optimal concentration.

Pruning methods have been considered in adversarial context to reduce model capacity and improve adversarial robustness simultaneously in training. Existing adversarial pruning methods generally mimic the classical pruning methods for natural training, which follow the three-stage 'training-pruning-fine-tuning' pipelines. We observe that such pruning methods do not necessarily preserve the dynamics of dense networks, making it potentially hard to be fine-tuned to compensate the accuracy degradation in pruning. Based on recent works of Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), we systematically study the dynamics of adversarial training and prove the existence of trainable sparse sub-network at initialization which can be trained to be adversarial robust from scratch. This theoretically verifies the lottery ticket hypothesis in adversarial context and we refer such sub-network structure as Adversarial Winning Ticket (AWT).

Extending the successes in supervised learning methods to the reinforcement learning (RL) setting, however, is difficult due to the data generating process RL agents actively query their environment for data, and the data are a function of the policy followed by the agent. An agent could thus neglect a shift in the environment if its policy did not lead it to explore the aspect of the environment that shifted. Therefore, to achieve safe and robust generalization in RL, there exists an unmet need for OOD detection through active experimentation. Here, we attempt to bridge this lacuna by first defining a causal framework for OOD scenarios or environments encountered by RL agents in the wild. Then, we propose a novel task: that of Out-of-Task Distribution (OOTD) detection. We introduce an RL agent that actively experiments in a test environment and subsequently concludes whether it is OOTD or not. We name our method GalilAI, in honor of Galileo Galilei, as it discovers, among other causal processes, that gravitational acceleration is independent of the mass of a body. Finally, we propose a simple probabilistic neural network baseline for comparison, which extends extant Model-Based RL. We find that GalilAI outperforms the baseline significantly.

Therefore the best sample upper bound is proportional to (O) over tilde (1/epsilon(2)), where epsilon > 0 is the target accuracy of the obtained policy, and can be overly pessimistic. To tackle this issue, we provide an efficient algorithm that utilizes a gap parameter, rho > 0, to reduce the amount of exploration. In particular, for an unknown finite-horizon Markov decision process, the algorithm takes only (O) over tilde (1/epsilon . (H(3)SA/rho + H(4)S(2)A)) episodes of exploration, and is able to obtain an epsilon-optimal policy for a post-revealed reward with sub-optimality gap at least rho, where S is the number of states, A is the number of actions, and H is the length of the horizon, obtaining a nearly quadratic saving in terms of epsilon. We show that, information-theoretically, this bound is nearly tight for rho < Theta(1/(HS)) and H > 1.

A new formulation for learning a deep submodular set function that is consistent with the real-valued attribution maps obtained by existing attribution methods is proposed. The final attribution value of a feature is then defined as the marginal gain in the induced submodular score of the feature in the context of other highly attributed features, thus decreasing the attribution of redundant yet discriminatory features.

This class of algorithms is widely applied in robotics with movement primitives or non-differentiable policies. Furthermore, these approaches are particularly relevant where exploration at the action level could cause actuator damage or other safety issues. However, Black-box optimization does not scale well with the increasing dimensionality of the policy, leading to high demand for samples, which are expensive to obtain in real-world systems. In many practical applications, policy parameters do not contribute equally to the return. Identifying the most relevant parameters allows to narrow down the exploration and speed up the learning. Furthermore, updating only the effective parameters requires fewer samples, improving the scalability of the method. We present a novel method to prioritize the exploration of effective parameters and cope with full covariance matrix updates. Our algorithm learns faster than recent approaches and requires fewer samples to achieve state-of-the-art results.

We instead focus on assessing statistical bias in this empirical measure, and we identify better estimators.

However, the usage of MOT has been largely impeded by its computational complexity which scales exponentially in the number of marginals. Fortunately, in many applications, such as barycenter or interpolation problems, the cost function adheres to structures, which has recently been exploited for developing efficient computational methods. In this work we derive computational bounds for these methods. In particular, with m marginal distributions supported on n points, we provide a (O) over tilde (d(T)mn(w(G))+(1) epsilon(-2)) bound for a 6-accuracy when the problem is associated with a graph that can be factored as a junction tree with diameter d(T) and tree-width w(G).

On large input domains, sketching methods and hierarchical search methods are commonly and successfully, in practice, applied for reducing the size of the domain, and for identifying frequent elements. It is therefore of interest whether the current theoretical analysis of such algorithms is tight, or whether we can obtain algorithms in a similar vein that achieve optimal error guarantee. We introduce two algorithms for LDP frequency estimation. One solves the fundamental frequency oracle problem; the other solves the well-known heavy hitters identification problem. As a function of failure probability, beta, the former achieves optimal worst-case estimation error for every beta, the latter is optimal when beta is at least inverse polynomial in n, the number of users. In each algorithm, server running time and memory usage are (O) over tilde (n) and (O) over tilde(root n), respectively, while user running time and memory usage are both (O) over tilde (1). Our frequency-oracle algorithm achieves lower estimation error than Bassily et al. (NeurIPS 2017).

In this pursuit, we propose SAGE (Sampled Hedge) - a framework for designing efficient online learning policies by leveraging statistical sampling techniques. For a wide class of reward functions, we show that SAGE either achieves the first sublinear regret guarantee or improves upon the existing ones. Furthermore, going beyond the notion of regret, we fully characterize the mistake bounds achievable by online learning policies for stable loss functions. We conclude the paper by establishing a tight regret lower bound for a variant of the k-experts problem and carrying out experiments with standard datasets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2022,151,,,,,,342,365,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000828072700015,0

However, they are affected by competing interests: While a sufficiently large number of binary, non-smooth rules is necessary to fit smooth, well generalizing decision boundaries, a too high number of rules in the ensemble severely jeopardizes interpretability. As a way out of this dilemma, we propose to take an extra step in the rule extraction step and compress clusters of similar rules into ensemble rules. The outputs of the individual rules in each cluster are pooled to produce a single soft output, reflecting the original ensemble's marginal smoothing behaviour. The final model, that we call Compressed Rule Ensemble (CRE), fits a linear combination of ensemble rules. We empirically show that CRE is both sparse and accurate on various datasets, carrying over the ensemble behaviour while remaining interpretable. Predictions can be explained by looking at the active ensemble rules, allowing external validation. We showcase that ensemble rules are also useful for a wider range of models that utilize decision rules extracted from tree ensembles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2022,151,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000841852304024,0

In this case, we show that the asymptotic convergence rate of the MLE is quite poor, such as O(n(-1/6)) or even O(n(-1/8)). We then demonstrate via both theoretical arguments and extensive simulations that the MLE behaves like a threshold estimator in finite samples, in the sense that the MLE can give strong evidence that the means are equal when the truth is otherwise. We also explore the behavior of the MLE when the MLE is non-zero, showing that it is difficult to estimate both the sign and magnitude of the means in this case. We provide diagnostics for all of these pathologies and apply these ideas to re-analyzing two randomized evaluations of job training programs, JOBS II and Job Corps.

We propose an efficient data appraisal method based on forward influence functions that approximates data value through its first-order loss reduction on the current model. The method requires no additional hyper-parameters or re-training. We show that in private, forward influence functions provide an appealing trade-off between high quality appraisal and required computation, in spite of label noise, class imbalance, and missing data. Our work seeks to inspire an open market that incentivizes efficient, equitable exchange of domain-specific training data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2022,151,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000841852305042,0

Motivated to explicitly encode consistent bidirectional maps into the discrepancy measure, this work proposes a novel unbalanced Monge optimal transport formulation for matching, up to isometrics, distributions on different spaces. Our formulation arises as a principled relaxation of the Gromov-Haussdroff distance between metric spaces, and employs two cycle-consistent maps that push forward each distribution onto the other. We study structural properties of the proposed discrepancy and, in particular, show that it captures the popular cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (GAN) framework as a special case, thereby providing the theory to explain it. Motivated by computational efficiency, we then kernelize the discrepancy and restrict the mappings to parametric function classes. The resulting kernelized version is coined the generalized maximum mean discrepancy (GMMD).

Prior literature has thus far mainly focused on studying such problems in the continuous domain, e.g., convex-concave minimax optimization is now understood to a significant extent. Nevertheless, minimax problems extend far beyond the continuous domain to mixed continuous-discrete domains or even fully discrete domains. In this paper, we study mixed continuous-discrete minimax problems where the minimization is over a continuous variable belonging to Euclidean space and the maximization is over subsets of a given ground set. We introduce the class of convex-submodular minimax problems, where the objective is convex with respect to the continuous variable and submodular with respect to the discrete variable. Even though such problems appear frequently in machine learning applications, little is known about how to address them from algorithmic and theoretical perspectives. For such problems, we first show that obtaining saddle points are hard up to any approximation, and thus introduce new notions of (near-) optimality. We then provide several algorithmic procedures for solving convex and monotone-submodular minimax problems and characterize their convergence rates, computational complexity, and quality of the final solution according to our notions of optimally. Our proposed algorithms are iterative and combine tools from both discrete and continuous optimization.

Adaptive MCMC methods aim to address this by allowing the parameters to be updated during sampling based on previous samples from the chain at the expense of requiring a new theoretical analysis to ensure convergence. In this work we extend the convergence theory of adaptive MCMC methods to a new class of methods built on a powerful class of parametric density estimators known as normalizing flows. In particular, we consider an independent Metropolis-Hastings sampler where the proposal distribution is represented by a normalizing flow whose parameters are updated using stochastic gradient descent. We explore the practical performance of this procedure on both synthetic settings and in the analysis of a physical field system, and compare it against both adaptive and non-adaptive MCMC methods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2022,151,,,,,,5949,5986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000841852300016,0

Conventional approaches for dynamic scheduling find the optimal policy for a given specific system so that the policy from these approaches is usable only for the corresponding system characteristics. Hence, it is hard to use such approaches for a practical system in which system characteristics dynamically change. This paper proposes a novel policy structure for MDP-based dynamic scheduling, a descriptive policy, which has a system-agnostic capability to adapt to unseen system characteristics for an identical task (dynamic scheduling). To this end, the descriptive policy learns a system-agnostic scheduling principle-in a nutshell, which condition of items should have a higher priority in scheduling. The scheduling principle can be applied to any system so that the descriptive policy learned in one system can be used for another system. Experiments with simple explanatory and realistic application scenarios demonstrate that it enables system-agnostic meta-learning with very little performance degradation compared with the system-specific conventional policies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2022,151,,,,,,169,187,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000828072700009,0

Indeed, the small marginal effects of the noise may then accumulate quickly, shifting empirical closest and furthest neighbors away from the ground truth. In this paper, we exactly characterize such effects in noisy high-dimensional data using an asymptotic probabilistic expression. Previously, it has been argued that neighborhood queries become meaningless and unstable when distance concentration occurs, which means that there is a poor relative discrimination between the furthest and closest neighbors in the data. However, we conclude that this is not necessarily the case when we decompose the data in a ground truth-which we aim to recover-and noise component. More specifically, we derive that under particular conditions, empirical neighborhood relations affected by noise are still likely to be truthful even when distance concentration occurs.

The field of differential privacy has been developed to offer data analysis tools with strong privacy guarantees, and has been commonly applied to machine learning and statistical tasks.

In this work, we recast generalization over subgroups as an online game between a player minimizing risk and an adversary presenting new test distributions. Under an existing notion of inter- and extrapolation based on reweighting of sub-group likelihoods, we rigorously demonstrate that extrapolation is computationally much harder than interpolation, though their statistical complexity is not significantly different.

A fundamental limitation of virtually all such methods are computations involving the kernel matrix that naively scale quadratically (e.g., matrix-vector multiplication) or cubically (solving linear systems) with the size of the dataset N. We propose the Fast Kernel Transform (FKT), a general algorithm to compute matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs) for datasets in moderate dimensions with quasilinear complexity. Typically, analytically grounded fast multiplication methods require specialized development for specific kernels. In contrast, our scheme is based on auto-differentiation and automated symbolic computations that leverage the analytical structure of the underlying kernel. This allows the FKT to be easily applied to a broad class of kernels, including Gaussian, Matern, and Rational Quadratic covariance functions and Green's functions, including those of the Laplace and Helmholtz equations. Furthermore, the FKT maintains a high, quantifiable, and controllable level of accuracy-properties that many acceleration methods lack. We illustrate the efficacy and versatility of the FKT by providing timing and accuracy benchmarks with comparisons to adjacent methods, and by applying it to scale the stochastic neighborhood embedding (t-SNE) and Gaussian processes to large real-world datasets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2022,151,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000841852306010,0

Intuitively, the ordering task allows the model to attend to the least time-reversible features (for example, features that indicate progression of a chronic disease). The same features are often useful for downstream tasks of interest. To quantify this, we study a simple theoretical setting where we prove a finite-sample guarantee for the downstream error of a representation learned with order-contrastive pre-training.

This process is based on a minimal number of suitably-designed group tests on subsets of items, where the test outcome is positive iff the given test contains at least one defective item. Motivated by physical considerations, we consider a generalized setting that includes as special cases multiple other group-testing-like models in the literature. In our setting, which subsumes as special cases a variety of noiseless and noisy group-testing models in the literature, the test outcome is positive with probability f(x), where x is the number of defectives tested in a pool, and f(center dot) is an arbitrary monotonically increasing (stochastic) test function. Our main contributions are as follows. 1. We present a non-adaptive scheme that with probability 1 - epsilon identifies all defective items. Our scheme requires at most O(H(f)dlog(n/epsilon)) tests, where H(f) is a suitably defined sensitivity parameter of f(center dot), and is never larger than O(d(1+o(1))), but may be substantially smaller for many f(center dot). 2. We argue that any non-adaptive group testing scheme needs at least Omega((1 - epsilon)h(f)dlog(n/d)) tests to ensure reliable recovery. Here h(f) >= 1 is a suitably defined concentration parameter of f(center dot). 3. We prove that our sample-complexity bounds for generalized group testing are information-theoretically near-optimal for a variety of sparse-recovery group-testing models in the literature. That is, for any noisy test function f(center dot) (i.e., 0 < f(0) < f(d) < 1), and for a variety of (one-sided) noiseless test functions f(center dot) (i.e., either f(0)=0, or f(d)=1, or both) studied in the literature we show that H(f)/h(f) is an element of Theta(1). As a by-product we tightly characterize the heretofore open information-theoretic sample-complexity for the well-studied model of threshold group-testing. For general (near)-noiseless test functions f(center dot) we show that H(f)/h(f) is an element of O(d(1+o(1))). We also demonstrate a natural test-function f(center dot) whose sample complexity scales extremally as Theta(d(2)log(n)), rather than Theta(dlog(n)) as in the case of classical group-testing. Some of our techniques may be of independent interest - in particular our achievability requires a delicate saddle-point approximation, and our impossibility proof relies on a novel bound relating the mutual information of pair of random variables with the mean and variance of a specific function, and we derive novel structural results about monotone functions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2022,151,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000841852305014,0

This relaxation, that we call network DP, captures the fact that users have only a local view of the system. To show the relevance of network DP, we study a decentralized model of computation where a token performs a walk on the network graph and is updated sequentially by the party who receives it. For tasks such as real summation, histogram computation and optimization with gradient descent, we propose simple algorithms on ring and complete topologies. We prove that the privacy-utility trade-offs of our algorithms under network DP significantly improve upon what is achievable under LDP, and often match the utility of the trusted curator model. Our results show for the first time that formal privacy gains can be obtained from full decentralization.

In this paper, we propose instead to use Sinkhorn's algorithm to make attention matrices doubly stochastic. We call the resulting model a Sinkformer. We show that the row-wise stochastic attention matrices in classical Transformers get close to doubly stochastic matrices as the number of epochs increases, justifying the use of Sinkhorn normalization as an informative prior. On the theoretical side, we show that, unlike the SoftMax operation, this normalization makes it possible to understand the iterations of self-attention modules as a discretized gradient-flow for the Wasserstein metric. We also show in the infinite number of samples limit that, when rescaling both attention matrices and depth, Sinkformers operate a heat diffusion. On the experimental side, we show that Sinkformers enhance model accuracy in vision and natural language processing tasks. In particular, on 3D shapes classification, Sinkformers lead to a significant improvement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2022,151,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000828072703025,0

For noiseless observations of constraint functions, we propose a generic method using a Bayesian approach based on a class of penalty functions, and prove that it can achieve a sublinear regret with respect to the global optimum and a sublinear constraint violation (CV), which can match the best results of previous methods. Additionally, we propose another method to deal with the case where constraint functions are observed with noise, which can achieve a sublinear regret and a sublinear CV with more assumptions.

However, given the changing context with previous observations, the subset of predictive features to select may change dynamically. Therefore, we face the challenging new problem of foresight dynamic selection (FDS): finding a dynamic and light-weight policy to decide which features to observe next, before actually observing them, for overall performance-cost trade-o.s. To tackle FDS, this paper proposes a Bayesian learning framework of Variational Foresight Dynamic Selection (VFDS). VFDS learns a policy that selects the next feature subset to observe, by optimizing a variational Bayesian objective that characterizes the trade-o. between model performance and feature cost. At its core is an implicit variational distribution on binary gates that are dependent on previous observations, which will select the next subset of features to observe. We apply VFDS on the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) task where the performance-cost trade-o. is critical in its practice. Extensive results demonstrate that VFDS selects di.erent features under changing contexts, notably saving sensory costs while maintaining or improving the HAR accuracy. Moreover, the features that VFDS dynamically select are shown to be interpretable and associated with the di.erent activity types.

These rates effectively cancel, and so Dropout regularizes against higher-order interactions. We prove this perspective analytically and empirically. This perspective of Dropout as a regularizer against interaction effects has several practical implications: (1) higher Dropout rates should be used when we need stronger regularization against spurious high-order interactions, (2) caution should be exercised when interpreting Dropout-based explanations and uncertainty measures, and (3) networks trained with Input Dropout are biased estimators.

Despite achieving impressive performance, most of the current state-of-the-art classifiers remain highly vulnerable to crafted imperceptible, adversarial perturbations. Recent research attempts to understand neural network attack and defense have become increasingly urgent and important. While rapid progress has been made on this front, there is still an important theoretical gap in achieving guaranteed bounds on attack/defense models, leaving uncertainty in the certified guarantees of these models. To this end, we systematically address this problem in this paper. More specifically, we formulate attack and defense in a generic setting where there exists a family of adversaries (i.e., attackers) for attacking a family of classifiers (i.e., defenders). We develop a novel class of f-divergences suitable for measuring divergence among multiple distributions. This equips us to study the interactions between attackers and defenders in a countervailing game where we formulate a joint risk on attack and defense schemes. This is followed by our key results on guaranteed upper and lower bounds on this risk that can provide a better understanding of the behaviors of those parties from the attack and defense perspectives, thereby having important implications to both attack and defense sides. Finally, benefited from our theory, we propose an empirical approach that bases on global view to defend against adversarial attacks.

In MCMC samplers of continuous random variables, Markov chain couplings can overcome bias. But these approaches depend crucially on paired chains meetings after a small number of transitions. We show that straightforward applications of existing coupling ideas to discrete clustering variables fail to meet quickly. This failure arises from the label-switching problem: semantically equivalent cluster relabelings impede fast meeting of coupled chains. We instead consider chains as exploring the space of partitions rather than partitions' (arbitrary) labelings. Using a metric on the partition space, we formulate a practical algorithm using optimal transport couplings. Our theory confirms our method is accurate and efficient.

While in simple cases, such as in bandits, passive and active data collection are similarly effective, the price of passive sampling can be much higher when collecting data from a system with controlled states. The main focus of the current paper is the characterization of this price. For example, when learning in episodic finite state-action Markov decision processes (MDPs) with S states and A actions, we show that even with the best (but passively chosen) logging policy, Omega(A(min(S-1,)(H))/epsilon(2)) episodes are necessary (and sufficient) to obtain an epsilon-optimal policy, where H is the length of episodes. Note that this shows that the sample complexity blows up exponentially compared to the case of active data collection, a result which is not unexpected, but, as far as we know, have not been published beforehand and perhaps the form of the exact expression is a little surprising.

An interesting property of this objective is that it admits simple linear Bellman equations that resemble, up to a reward transformation, those of the risk-neutral case. However, the required reward transformation is policy-dependent, and requires the (usually unknown) expected return of the used policy.

In this work, we propose the Incremental (Spline) Quantile Functions I(S)QF, a flexible and efficient distribution-free quantile estimation framework that resolves quantile crossing with a simple neural network layer. Moreover, I(S)QF inter/extrapolate to predict arbitrary quantile levels that differ from the underlying training ones.

For instance, local modes (i.e., local maxima) can be used for clustering, while the global mode (i.e., the global maximum) is a robust alternative to the Frechet mean. Previously, to estimate the modes, an iterative method has been proposed based on a Riemannian gradient estimator and empirically showed the superior performance in clustering (Ashizawa et al., 2017). However, it has not been theoretically investigated if the iterative method is able to capture the modes based on the gradient estimator. In this paper, we propose simple iterative methods for mode estimation on matrix manifolds based on the Euclidean metric. A key contribution is to perform theoretical analysis and establish sufficient conditions for the monotonic ascending and convergence of the proposed iterative methods. In addition, for the previous method, we prove the monotonic ascending property towards a mode. Thus, our work can be also regarded as compensating for the lack of theoretical analysis in the previous method. Furthermore, the robustness of the iterative methods is theoretically investigated in terms of the breakdown point.

Our first result offers a lower bound on a weak form of information loss as a function of its respective operation loss when adopting a discrete lossy representation (quantization) instead of the original raw observation. From this, our main result shows that a specific form of vanishing information loss (a weak notion of asymptotic informational sufficiency) implies a vanishing MPE loss (or asymptotic operational sufficiency) when considering a family of lossy continuous representations. Our theoretical findings support the observation that the selection of feature representations that attempt to capture informational sufficiency is appropriate for learning, but this design principle is a rather conservative if the intended goal is achieving MPE in classification. On this last point, we discuss about studying weak forms of informational sufficiencies to achieve operational sufficiency in learning settings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2022,151,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000828072704043,0

We close this gap by devising the first optimal algorithm, the Lifted Primal-Dual (LPD) method. Our method lifts the objective into an extended form that allows both the smooth terms and the bilinear term to be handled optimally and seamlessly with the same primal-dual framework. Besides optimality, our method yields a desirably simple single-loop algorithm that uses only one gradient oracle call per iteration.

This approach constructs two diverse shared latent spaces, performs domain alignment in each of them, and punishes the disagreements of these two alignments with respect to the predictions on unlabeled data.

These operations quickly become expensive as the dimension of the matrices grows. To bypass this limitation, we propose the landing algorithm which does not use retractions. The algorithm is not constrained to stay on the manifold but its evolution is driven by a potential energy which progressively attracts it towards the manifold. One iteration of the landing algorithm only involves matrix multiplications, which makes it cheap compared to its retraction counterparts.

In particular we demonstrate that larger encoder variances reduce the high frequency content of these functions. Our analysis allows us to show that increasing this variance effectively induces a soft Lipschitz constraint on the decoder network of a VAE, which is a core contributor to the adversarial robustness of VAEs. We further demonstrate that adding Gaussian noise to the input of a VAE allows us to more finely control the frequency content and the Lipschitz constant of the VAE encoder networks.

Furthermore, we perform experimental comparisons with the optimistic variant of the multiplicative weights update method, by (Daskalakis and Panageas, 2019) and show that our algorithm has significant practical potential since it offersoffers substantial gains in terms of accelerated convergence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2022,151,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000841852305027,0

Much less attention has been paid to automatic tuning of generalized HMC (GHMC), in which the auxiliary momentum vector is partially updated frequently instead of being completely resampled infrequently. Since GHMC spreads progress over many iterations, it is not straightforward to tune GHMC based on quantities typically used to tune HMC such as average acceptance rate and squared jumped distance. In this work, we propose an ensemble-chain adaptation (ECA) algorithm for GHMC that automatically selects values for all of GHMC's tunable parameters each iteration based on statistics collected from a population of many chains. This algorithm is designed to make good use of SIMD hardware accelerators such as GPUs, allowing most chains to be updated in parallel each iteration. Unlike typical adaptive-MCMC algorithms, our ECA algorithm does not perturb the chain's stationary distribution, and therefore does not need to be frozen after warmup.

In this paper, we seek for a reward-free compression of the policy space into a finite set of representative policies, such that, given any policy pi, the minimum Renyi divergence between the state-action distributions of the representative policies and the state-action distribution of pi is bounded. We show that this compression of the policy space can be formulated as a set cover problem, and it is inherently NP-hard.

We take a different approach, and advocate studying the generalization performance of decision trees with respect to different generative regression models. This allows us to elicit their inductive bias, that is, the assumptions the algorithms make (or do not make) to generalize to new data, thereby guiding practitioners on when and how to apply these methods. In this paper, we focus on sparse additive generative models, which have both low statistical complexity and some nonparametric flexibility. We prove a sharp squared error generalization lower bound for a large class of decision tree algorithms fitted to sparse additive models with C-1 component functions. This bound is surprisingly much worse than the minimax rate for estimating such sparse additive models. The inefficiency is due not to greediness, but to the loss in power for detecting global structure when we average responses solely over each leaf, an observation that suggests opportunities to improve tree-based algorithms, for example, by hierarchical shrinkage. To prove these bounds, we develop new technical machinery, establishing a novel connection between decision tree estimation and rate-distortion theory, a sub-field of information theory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2022,151,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000841852304008,0

This paper addresses the study of epistemic uncertainty within an information-theoretic framework in the broader setting of Bayesian meta-learning. A general hierarchical Bayesian model is assumed in which hyperparameters determine the per-task priors of the model parameters.

In this work, we show that mean-field variational inference entirely fails to model the data when the network width is large and the activation function is odd. Specifically, for fully-connected BNNs with odd activation functions and a homoscedastic Gaussian likelihood, we show that the optimal mean-field variational posterior predictive (i.e., function space) distribution converges to the prior predictive distribution as the width tends to infinity. We generalize aspects of this result to other likelihoods. Our theoretical results are suggestive of underfitting behavior previously observered in BNNs. While our convergence bounds are non-asymptotic and constants in our analysis can be computed, they are currently too loose to be applicable in standard training regimes.

There are many possible choices for such value functions, which broadly fall into two categories: on-manifold and off-manifold value functions, which take an observational and an interventional viewpoint respectively.

We formalize the desiderata of value functions that respect both the model and the data manifold in a set of axioms and are robust to perturbation on off-manifold regions, and show that there exists a unique value function that satisfies these axioms, which we term the Joint Baseline value function, and the resulting Shapley value the Joint Baseline Shapley (JBshap), and validate the effectiveness of JBshap in experiments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2022,151,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000828072701025,0

Concretely, in that sampler, whenever a new cluster is formed it is augmented with two subclusters whose labels are initialized at random. Upon their evolution, the subclusters serve to propose a split of the parent cluster. We show that the random initialization is often problematic and hurts the otherwise-effective sampler. Specifically, we demonstrate that this initialization tends to lead to poor split proposals and/or too many iterations before a desired split is accepted. This slows convergence and can damage the clustering. As a remedy, we propose two drop-in-replacement options for the subcluster-initialization subroutine. The first is an intuitive heuristic while the second is based on deep learning.

Within this framework, we propose preference exploration strategies specifically designed for this task, and demonstrate their performance via extensive simulation studies.",,,,,,"Frazier, Peter/0000-0002-3501-3341",,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2022,151,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000828072704014,0

When training a flexible discriminative model using a strictly proper loss, such noise will inevitably shift the solution towards the conditional distribution over noisy labels. Nevertheless, while deep neural networks have proven capable of fitting random labels, regularisation and the use of robust loss functions empirically mitigate the effects of label noise. However, such observations concern robustness in accuracy, which is insufficient if reliable uncertainty quantification is critical. We demonstrate this by analysing the properties of the conditional distribution over noisy labels for an input-dependent noise model. In addition, we evaluate the set of robust loss functions characterised by noise-insensitive, asymptotic risk minimisers. We find that strictly proper and robust loss functions both offer asymptotic robustness in accuracy, but neither guarantee that the final model is calibrated. Moreover, even with robust loss functions, overfitting is an issue in practice. With these results, we aim to explain observed robustness of common training practices, such as early stopping, to label noise. In addition, we aim to encourage the development of new noise-robust algorithms that not only preserve accuracy but that also ensure reliability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2022,151,,,,,,922,942,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000828072700039,0

We study this problem under the strong stochastic transitivity (SST) noise model which is a widely studied ranking model and captures many applications. A special case of this model is the noisy comparison model for which it was recently shown that O(n log k) comparisons and log* n rounds of adaptivity are sufficient to find the set of top-k items (Cohen-Addad et al., 2020; Braverman et al., 2019).

A major drawback of adaptive importance sampling is the large variance of the weights which is known to badly impact the accuracy of the estimates. This paper investigates a regularization strategy whose basic principle is to raise the importance weights at a certain power. This regularization parameter, that might evolve between zero and one during the algorithm, is shown (i) to balance between the bias and the variance and (ii) to be connected to the mirror descent framework. Using a kernel density estimate to build the sampling policy, the uniform convergence is established under mild conditions.

Under Triple-Q, at each step, an action is chosen based on the pseudo-Q-value that is a combination of the three Q values. The algorithm updates the reward and utility Q-values with learning rates that depend on the visit counts to the corresponding (state, action) pairs and are periodically reset. In the episodic CMDP setting, Triple-Q achieves (O) over tilde (1/delta H(4)S(1/2)A(1/2)K(4/5)) regret(1), where K is the total number of episodes, H is the number of steps in each episode, S is the number of states, A is the number of actions, and delta is Slater's constant.

For example, elastic weight consolidation (EWC) regularizes with a quadratic form involving a diagonal matrix build based on past data. While EWC works very well for some setups, we show that, even under otherwise ideal conditions, it can provably suffer catastrophic forgetting if the diagonal matrix is a poor approximation of the Hessian matrix of previous tasks. We propose a simple approach to overcome this: Regularizing training of a new task with sketches of the Jacobian matrix of past data.

We show that such restrictions can be alleviated if the ATE from the cluster perspective is considered. Using an illustrative example, we further show that the weights employed by the Horvitz-Thompson estimator may not appropriately accommodate the network structure, and purely relying on graph-cluster randomization may generate very unbalanced cluster-treated structures across the treatment arms. The measures of such structures for one cluster may depend on the treatment of other clusters and pose a great challenge for the design of A/B tests.

In this work, we identify that synchronous FL - synchronized aggregation of client updates in FL - cannot scale efficiently beyond a few hundred clients training in parallel. It leads to diminishing returns in model performance and training speed, analogous to large-batch training. On the other hand, asynchronous aggregation of client updates in FL (i.e., asynchronous FL) alleviates the scalability issue. However, aggregating individual client updates is incompatible with Secure Aggregation, which could result in an undesirable level of privacy for the system. To address these concerns, we propose a novel buffered asynchronous aggregation method, FedBuff, that is agnostic to the choice of optimizer, and combines the best properties of synchronous and asynchronous FL. We empirically demonstrate that FedBuff is 3.3x more efficient than synchronous FL and up to 2.5x more efficient than asynchronous FL, while being compatible with privacy-preserving technologies such as Secure Aggregation and differential privacy. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees in a smooth non-convex setting.

A top-down Convolution Network maps a novel hierarchical latent space to time series windows, exploiting temporal dynamics to encode information efficiently. Despite relying on posterior sampling, it is computationally more efficient than current approaches, with up to 10x shorter training times than RNN based models. Our method outperformed current state-of-the-art models on four popular benchmark datasets. Finally, DGHL is robust to variable features between entities and accurate even with large proportions of missing values, settings with increasing relevance with the advent of IoT.

Although graph-valued signals of this type have been previously studied in the literature for the different tasks of testing for the presence of an anomalous cluster and of estimating the mean vector, no localisation results are known outside the classical case of chain graphs. When the partition S consists of only two elements, we characterise the difficulty of the localisation problem in terms of four key parameters: the maximal noise variance sigma(2), the size Delta of the smaller element of the partition, the magnitude kappa of the difference in the signal values across contiguous elements of the partition and the sum of the effective resistance edge weights vertical bar partial derivative(r)(S)vertical bar of the corresponding cut - a graph theoretic quantity quantifying the size of the partition boundary.

We then estimate the instantaneous rate of change of the bridge distributions indexed by time (the time score)-a quantity defined analogously to data (Stein) scores-with a novel time score matching objective.

We develop and investigate a personalizable deep metric model that captures both the internal contents of items and how they were interacted with by users. There are two key challenges in learning such model. First, there is no explicit similarity annotation, which deviates from the assumption of most metric learning methods. Second, these approaches ignore the fact that items are often represented by multiple sources of meta data and different users use different combinations of these sources to form their own notion of similarity. To address these challenges, we develop a new metric representation embedded as kernel parameters of a probabilistic model. This helps express the correlation between items that a user has interacted with, which can be used to predict user interaction with new items. Our approach hinges on the intuition that similar items induce similar interactions from the same user, thus fitting a metric-parameterized model to predict an implicit feedback signal could indirectly guide it towards finding the most suitable metric for each user.

In the literature, fraud detection challenges and algorithms performance are widely studied but the very formulation of the problem is never disrupted: it aims at predicting if a transaction is fraudulent based on its characteristics and the past transactions of the cardholder. Yet, in posterior detection, verification often takes days, so new payments on the card become available before a decision is taken. This is our motivation to propose a new paradigm: posterior fraud detection with future information. We start by providing evidence of the on-time availability of subsequent transactions, usable as extra context to improve detection. We then design a Bidirectional LSTM to make use of these transactions. On a real-world dataset with over 30 million transactions, it achieves higher performance than a regular LSTM, which is the state-of-the-art classifier for fraud detection that only uses the past context. We also introduce new metrics to show that the proposal catches more frauds, more compromised cards, and based on their earliest frauds.

We assess existing functional transfer methods on their ability to transfer equivariance and empirically show that they fail to even transfer shift equivariance, one of the simplest equivariances. Further theoretical analysis demonstrates that representational similarity methods, in fact, cannot guarantee the transfer of the intended equivariance. Motivated by these findings, we develop a novel transfer method that learns an equivariance model from a given teacher network and encourages the student network to acquire the same equivariance, via regularization.

It was shown by Faury et al. (2020) that the learning-theoretic difficulties of Logistic Bandits can be embodied by a large (sometimes prohibitively) problem-dependent constant kappa, characterizing the magnitude of the reward's non-linearity. In this paper we introduce a novel algorithm for which we provide a refined analysis. This allows for a better characterization of the effect of non-linearity and yields improved problem-dependent guarantees. In most favorable cases this leads to a regret upper-bound scaling as (O) over tilde (d root T/kappa), which dramatically improves over the (O) over tilde (d root T + kappa) state-of-the-art guarantees. We prove that this rate is minimax-optimal by deriving a Omega(d root T/kappa) problem-dependent lower-bound. Our analysis identifies two regimes (permanent and transitory) of the regret, which ultimately re-conciliates (Faury et al., 2020) with the Bayesian approach of Dong et al. (2019). In contrast to previous works, we find that in the permanent regime non-linearity can dramatically ease the exploration-exploitation trade-off. While it also impacts the length of the transitory phase in a problem-dependent fashion, we show that this impact is mild in most reasonable configurations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2021,130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000659893804045,0

First, we build on a recent result by Chen et al. (2020) which showed noise tolerance of distribution-independently evolvable concept classes under Massart noise. Specifically, we extend their characterization to more general noise models, including the Tsybakov model which considerably generalizes the Massart condition by allowing the flipping probability to be arbitrarily close to 1/2 for a subset of the domain. As a corollary, we employ an evolutionary algorithm by Kanade et al. (2010) to obtain the first polynomial time algorithm with arbitrarily small excess error for learning linear threshold functions over any spherically symmetric distribution in the presence of spherically symmetric Tsybakov noise. Moreover, we posit access to a stronger oracle, in which for every labeled example we additionally obtain its flipping probability. In this model, we show that every SQ learnable class admits an efficient learning algorithm with OPT+subset of misclassification error for a broad class of noise models. This setting substantially generalizes the widely-studied problem of classification under RCN with known noise rate, and corresponds to a non-convex optimization problem even when the noise function - i.e. the flipping probabilities of all points -is known in advance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2021,130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000659893804058,0

Our goal in this work is to weaken this requirement, and as a step towards this, we study a \semi-random model. In this model, every covariate is revealed with probability p, and then an adversary comes in and reveals additional covariates. While the model seems intuitively easier, it is well known that algorithms such as HSVT perform poorly.

As ML becomes more ubiquitous, it is often deployed by companies to compete over customers. For example, digital platforms like Yelp use ML to predict user preference and make recommendations. A service that is more often queried by users, perhaps because it more accurately anticipates user preferences, is also more likely to obtain additional user data (e.g. in the form of a Yelp review). Thus, competing predictors cause feedback loops whereby a predictor's performance impacts what training data it receives and biases its predictions over time. We introduce a flexible model of competing ML predictors that enables both rapid experimentation and theoretical tractability. We show with empirical and mathematical analysis that competition causes predictors to specialize for specific sub-populations at the cost of worse performance over the general population. We further analyze the impact of predictor specialization on the overall prediction quality experienced by users. We show that having too few or too many competing predictors in a market can hurt the overall prediction quality.

We have unlabeled observations coming from multiple linear regressions, and each observation corresponds to exactly one of the regression models. The goal is to learn the linear regressors from the observations. Classically, Alternating Minimization (AM) (which is a variant of Expectation Maximization (EM)) is used to solve this problem. AM iteratively alternates between the estimation of labels and solving the regression problems with the estimated labels. Empirically, it is observed that, for a large variety of non-convex problems including mixed linear regression, AM converges at a much faster rate compared to gradient based algorithms. However, the existing theory suggests similar rate of convergence for AM and gradient based methods, failing to capture this empirical behavior. In this paper, we close this gap between theory and practice for the special case of a mixture of 2 linear regressions. We show that, provided initialized properly, AM enjoys a super-linear rate of convergence in certain parameter regimes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that theoretically establishes such rate for AM. Hence, if we want to recover the unknown regressors upto an error (in l(2) norm) of epsilon, AM only takes O(log log(1/epsilon)) iterations.

We construct an ensemble of weak survival predictors which iteratively adapt the marginal distributions of the source and target data such that similar source patients contribute to the fit and ultimately improve predictions on target patients of interest. This represents the first boosting-based transfer learning algorithm in the survival analysis literature. We demonstrate the performance and utility of our algorithm on synthetic and real healthcare data collected at various locations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2019,89,,,,,,57,65,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000509687900007,0

Applying GP to higher dimensional settings is generally difficult due to the curse of dimensionality for nonparametric regression. Existing works makes strong assumptions such as the function is low-dimensional embedding (Wang et al., 2013) or is axis-aligned additive (Kandasamy et al., 2015). In this paper, we generalize the existing assumption to a projected-additive assumption. Our generalization provides the benefits of i) greatly increasing the space of functions that can be modeled by our approach, which covers the previous works (Wang et al., 2013; Kandasamy et al., 2015) as special cases, and ii) efficiently handling the learning in a larger model space. We prove that the regret for projected-additive functions has only linear dependence on the number of dimensions in this general setting. Directly using projected-additive GP (Gilboa et al., 2013) to BO results in a non-box constraint, which is not easy to optimize. We tackle this problem by proposing a restricted-projection-pursuit GP for BO. We conduct experiments on synthetic examples and scientific and hyper-parameter tuning tasks in many cases.

The main contributions of this work are twofold; first we establish that existing BC methods do not possess local adaptivity in the sense of many classical adaptive methods and secondly, we developed a novel BC method whose behaviour, demonstrated empirically, is analogous to such methods. Finally we present evidence that the novel method provides improved cubature performance, relative to standard BC, in a detailed empirical assessment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2020,108,,,,,,1265,1274,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000559931301003,0

We show that our algorithm is equivalent Exp2 on {0, 1}n, Online Mirror Descent(OMD), Follow The Regularized Leader(FTRL) and Follow The Perturbed Leader(FTPL) algorithms. We show PolyExp achieves expected regret bound that is a factor of better than Exp2 in the full information setting under L adversarial losses. Because of the equivalence of these algorithms, this implies an improvement on Exp2's regret bound in full information. We also show matching regret lower bounds. Finally, we show how to use PolyExp on the {-1,+1}n hypercube, solving an open problem in Bubeck et al (COLT 2012).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2019,89,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000509687901099,0

The learned distribution allows us to remove unimportant units, resulting in a compact architecture containing only crucial features for a task at hand. The number of newly introduced Dirichlet parameters is only linear in the number of channels, which allows for rapid training, requiring as little as one epoch to converge.

The assumed Markovian structure on the coefficients enables us to encode temporal dependencies into a low-dimensional feature space. The proposed inference method is solely based on an approximate extended Kalman filtering scheme, which makes the resulting method particularly efficient. PSMF can account for temporal nonlinearities and, more importantly, can be used to calibrate and estimate generic differentiable nonlinear subspace models.

Designing safe reinforcement learning algorithms with provable computational and statistical efficiency is particularly challenging under this setting because of the need to incorporate both the safety constraint and the function approximation into the fundamental exploitation/exploration tradeoff. To this end, we present an Optimistic Primal-Dual Proximal Policy OPtimization (OPDOP) algorithm where the value function is estimated by combining the least-squares policy evaluation and an additional bonus term for safe exploration.

To be precise, given a random matrix Z with i.i.d. Gaussian entries, we show that a sketch ZK corresponds to a particular random operator in (infinite-dimensional) Hilbert space H that maps functions f is an element of H to a low-dimensional space R-d, while preserving a weighted RKHS inner-product of the form < f, g >(Sigma) (=)over dot < f, Sigma(3)g >(H), where Sigma is the covariance operator induced by the data distribution. In particular, under similar assumptions as in kernel PCA (KPCA), or kernel k-means (K-k-means), well-separated subsets of feature-space {K(., x) : x is an element of X} remain well-separated after such operation, which suggests similar benefits as in KPCA and/or K-k-means, albeit at the much cheaper cost of a random projection. In particular, our convergence rates suggest that, given a large dataset {X-i}(N)(i=1) of size N, we can build the Gram matrix K on a much smaller subsample of size n << N, so that the sketch ZK is very cheap to obtain and subsequently apply as a projection operator on the original data {X-i}(N)(i=1).

The more strongly z is associated with x, the more reliable the estimate is, but such strong IVs are difficult to find. Instead, practitioners combine more commonly available IV candidates which are not necessarily strong, or even valid, IVs into a single summary that is plugged into causal effect estimators in place of an IV. In genetic epidemiology, such approaches are known as allele scores. Allele scores require strong assumptions independence and validity of all IV candidates for the resulting estimate to be reliable. To relax these assumptions, we propose Ivy, a new method to combine IV candidates that can handle correlated and invalid IV candidates in a robust manner. Theoretically, we characterize this robustness, its limits, and its impact on the resulting causal estimates. Empirically, we show that Ivy can correctly identify the directionality of known relationships and is robust against false discovery (median effect size <= 0.025) on three real-world datasets with no causal effects, while allele scores return more biased estimates (median effect size >= 0.118).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2020,108,,,,,,398,409,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000559931301087,0

In this work, we address two limitations of the former: generation of invalid and duplicate molecules. To improve validity rates, we develop a language model for small molecular substructures called fragments, loosely inspired by the well-known paradigm of Fragment-Based Drug Design. In other words, we generate molecules fragment by fragment, instead of atom by atom. To improve uniqueness rates, we present a frequency-based masking strategy that helps generate molecules with infrequent fragments. We show experimentally that our model largely outperforms other language model-based competitors, reaching state-of-the-art performances typical of graph-based approaches.

In the regime where n less than or similar to d(2)/log (J), our algorithms attain L-2 estimation error that is independent of d. For the special case of distribution estimation, we show that projecting the output estimate of an algorithm due to [ASZ18] on the probability simplex yields an L-2 error that depends only sub-logarithmically on J in the regime where n less than or similar to J(2)/log(J).

We assume that the learner can access several similar tasks. The goal of the learner is to transfer knowledge from the prior tasks to a similar but novel task. For p parameters, size of the support set k, and l samples per task, we show that T is an element of O((k log p)/l) tasks are sufficient in order to recover the common support of all tasks. With the recovered support, we can greatly reduce the sample complexity for estimating the parameter of the novel task, i.e., l is an element of O(1) with respect to T and p. We also prove that our rates are minimax optimal. A key difference between meta-learning and the classical multi-task learning, is that meta-learning focuses only on the recovery of the parameters of the novel task, while multi-task learning estimates the parameter of all tasks, which requires l to grow with T. Instead, our efficient meta-learning estimator allows for l to be constant with respect to T (i.e., few-shot learning).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2021,130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000659893802078,0

Recently, Heng & Jacob (2019) studied Metropolis HMC with couplings for unbiased Monte Carlo estimation, establishing a generic parallelizable scheme for HMC. However, in practice a different HMC method, multinomial HMC, is considered as the go-to method, e.g. as part of the no-U-turn sampler. In multinomial HMC, proposed states are not limited to end-points as in Metropolis HMC; instead points along the entire trajectory can be proposed. In this paper, we establish couplings for multinomial HMC, based on optimal transport for multinomial sampling in its transition. We prove an upper bound for the meeting time - the time it takes for the coupled chains to meet - based on the notion of local contractivity. We evaluate our methods using three targets: 1;000 dimensional Gaussians, logistic regression and log-Gaussian Cox point processes. Compared to Heng & Jacob (2019), coupled multinomial HMC generally attains a smaller meeting time, and is more robust to choices of step sizes and trajectory lengths, which allows re-use of existing adaptation methods for HMC. These improvements together paves the way for a wider and more practical use of coupled HMC methods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2021,130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000659893804040,0

In this setting, controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), which is the expected proportion of type I error, is an important challenge for making meaningful inferences. In this paper, we consider a setting where an ordered (possibly infinite) sequence of hypotheses arrives in a stream, and for each hypothesis we observe a p-value along with a set of features specific to that hypothesis. The decision whether or not to reject the current hypothesis must be made immediately at each timestep, before the next hypothesis is observed. This model provides a general way of leveraging the side (contextual) information in the data to help maximize the number of discoveries while controlling the FDR. We propose a new class of powerful online testing procedures, where the rejection thresholds are learned sequentially by incorporating contextual information and previous results. We prove that any rule in this class controls online FDR under some standard assumptions. We then focus on a subclass of these procedures, based on weighting the rejection thresholds, to derive a practical algorithm that learns a parametric weight function in an online fashion to gain more discoveries. We also theoretically prove that our proposed procedures, under some easily verifiable assumptions, would lead to an increase of statistical power over a popular online testing procedure proposed by (Javanmard and Montanari, 2018).

In the hopes of explaining this performance, we study it through the lens of competitive distribution estimation: the ability to perform as well as an oracle aware of further structure in the data. We first establish basic competitive properties of Kneser-Ney smoothing. We then investigate the nature of its backoff mechanism and show that it emerges from first principles, rather than being an assumption of the model. We do this by generalizing the Good-Turing estimator to the contextual setting. This exploration leads us to a powerful generalization of Kneser-Ney, which we conjecture to have even stronger competitive properties. Empirically, it significantly improves performance on language modeling, even matching feed-forward neural models.

In many problems of practical interest this assumption is unrealistic since nowadays most user-owned devices collect large quantities of data (e.g. pictures, text messages, time series). We propose to model this scenario by assuming each individual holds a distribution over the space of data records, and develop novel local DP methods to sample privately from these distributions. Our main contribution is a boosting-based density estimation algorithm for learning samplers that generate synthetic data while protecting the underlying distribution of each user with local DP.

In the theoretical analysis, we show the global convergence of the method under a standard margin assumption on a data distribution instead of a weak learning condition, and we eliminate a worse dependence on the network depth in a generalization bound via a fine-grained convergence analysis. Moreover, we show that the existence of a learnable function with a large margin on a training dataset significantly improves a generalization bound.

This resolves the problem of unidentifiability of the standard VAE normal prior.

This paper takes a step towards demystifying this phenomena. Under a rich dataset model, we show that gradient descent is provably robust to noise/corruption on a constant fraction of the labels despite overparameterization. In particular, we prove that: (i) In the first few iterations where the updates are still in the vicinity of the initialization gradient descent only fits to the correct labels essentially ignoring the noisy labels. (ii) to start to overfit to the noisy labels network must stray rather far from from the initialization which can only occur after many more iterations.

Generally, the rate of training deep models reduces severely after multiple iterations. A key reason for this phenomenon is that a deep network is expressed using a highly non-convex finite-dimensional model, and thus the parameter gets stuck in a local optimum. Because of this, methods often suffer not only from degeneration of the convergence speed but also from limitations in the representational power of the trained network. To overcome this issue, we propose an additional layer called the gradient layer to seek a descent direction in an infinite-dimensional space. Because the layer is constructed in the infinite-dimensional space, we are not restricted by the specific model structure of finite-dimensional models. As a result, we can get out of the local optima in finite-dimensional models and move towards the global optimal function more directly. In this paper, this phenomenon is explained from the functional gradient method perspective of the gradient layer. Interestingly, the optimization procedure using the gradient layer naturally constructs the deep structure of the network. Moreover, we demonstrate that this procedure can be regarded as a discretization method of the gradient flow that naturally reduces the objective function. Finally, the method is tested using several numerical experiments, which show its fast convergence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2018,84,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000509385300106,0

However, the corresponding theoretical analysis remains inadequate for first-order solvers, as only local and kth gap-dependent rates of convergence have been established thus far. This paper is devoted to revealing significantly better or asyet-unknown theoretical properties of such solvers. We present a novel convergence analysis in a unified framework for three types of first-order Riemannian solvers, i.e., deterministic, vanilla stochastic, and stochastic with variance reduction, that are to find top-k eigenvectors of a real symmetric matrix, in full generality. In particular, the issue of zero gaps between eigenvalues, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, is explicitly considered for these solvers, which brings new understandings, e.g., the dependence of convergence on gaps other than the k-th one. We thus propose the concept of generalized k-th gap.

We perform rate-distortion analyses that control the strength of the rate term, the network capacity, and the difficulty of the generalization problem. Decreasing the strength of the rate paradoxically improves generalization in most settings, and reducing the mutual information typically leads to underfitting. Moreover, we show that generalization continues to improve even after the mutual information saturates, indicating that the gap on the bound (i.e. the KL divergence relative to the inference marginal) affects generalization.

However, we need to compute a matrix decomposition of the entry-wisely transformed matrix, f(A) := (f(a(i, j))) for some function f. Is it possible to do it in a space efficient way? Many machine learning applications indeed need to deal with such large transformed matrices, for example word embedding method in NLP needs to work with the pointwise mutual information (PMI) matrix, while the entrywise transformation makes it difficult to apply known linear algebraic tools. Existing approaches for this problem either need to store the whole matrix and perform the entry-wise transformation afterwards, which is space consuming or infeasible, or need to redesign the learning method, which is application specific and requires substantial remodeling.

This approximation technique is now standard in data science, and many software systems use sketched regression internally, as a component. It is often useful to calculate derivatives (gradients for the purpose of optimization, for example) of such large systems, where sketched LLS is merely a component of a larger system whose derivatives are needed. To support Automatic Differentiation (AD) of systems containing sketched LLS, we consider propagating derivatives through LLS: both propagating perturbations (forward AD) and gradients (reverse AD). AD performs accurate differentiation and is efficient for problems with a huge number of independent variables. Since we use LLSs (sketched LLS) instead of LLS for reasons of efficiency, propagation of derivatives also needs to trade accuracy for efficiency, presumably by sketching. There are two approaches for this: (a) use AD to transform the code that defines LLSs, or (b) approximate exact derivative propagation through LLS using sketching methods. We provide strong bounds on the errors produced due to these two natural forms of sketching in the context of AD, giving the first dimensionality reduction analysis for calculating the derivatives of a sketched computation. Our results crucially depend on a novel analysis of the operator norm of a sketched inverse matrix product in this context. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our sketched gradients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2020,108,,,,,,4367,4375,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000559931302012,0

But these approximations incur a running time roughly cubic in dimension - and we show that, besides computational issues, their accuracy dramatically deteriorates in high dimensions. Authors have suggested many potential and seemingly intuitive solutions, but these methods have not yet been systematically evaluated or compared. We find that all but one perform so poorly as to be unusable for approximating LOOCV. Crucially, though, we are able to show, both empirically and theoretically, that one approximation can perform well in high dimensions in cases where the high-dimensional parameter exhibits sparsity. Under interpretable assumptions, our theory demonstrates that the problem can be reduced to working within an empirically recovered (small) support.

The objective is to identify an epsilon-optimal ranking of the n items with probability at least 1 - delta. When the feedback in each subset round is a single Plackett-Luce-sampled item, we show (epsilon,delta)-PAC algorithms with a sample complexity of O(n/epsilon 2 ln n/delta) rounds, which we establish as being order-optimal by exhibiting a matching sample complexity lower bound of Omega (n/epsilon 2 ln n/delta)-In this shows that there is essentially no improvement possible from the pairwise comparisons setting (k = 2).

Whereas the distributions in the standard bandit setting are primarily characterized by their means, a number of subtleties arise when we care about the minimal cost as opposed to the average cost.

We run k-WL on the original graphical model, and not on the far larger graph of the linear program (LP) as proposed in earlier work in the field.

The fact that k-WL can be used in this manner follows from the recently introduced notion of k-local LPs and their relation to Sherali Adams relaxations of graph automorphisms.

First, we introduce a neural net compression scheme based on random linear sketching (which is usually implemented efficiently via hashing), and show that the sketched (smaller) network is able to approximate the original network on all input data coming from any smooth and well-conditioned low-dimensional manifold. The sketched network can also be trained directly via back-propagation.

To overcome this challenge, we introduce a new mechanism, Pure Bundling with Disposal for Cost (PBDC), where after buying the bundle, the customer is allowed to return any subset of goods for their costs. We provide two types of guarantees on the profit of PBDC mechanisms relative to the optimum in the presence of production costs, under the assumption that customers have valuations which are additive over the items and drawn independently. We first provide a distribution-dependent guarantee which shows that PBDC earns at least 1 6c(2/3) of the optimal profit, where c denotes the coefficient of variation of the welfare random variable. c approaches 0 if there are a large number of items whose individual valuations have bounded coefficients of variation, and our constants improve upon those from the classical result of Bakos and Brynjolfsson (1999) without costs.

In particular, we focus on eliciting binary classification performance metrics from pairwise feedback, where a practitioner is queried to provide relative preference between two classifiers. By exploiting key geometric properties of the space of confusion matrices, we obtain provably query efficient algorithms for eliciting linear and linear-fractional performance metrics. We further show that our method is robust to feedback and finite sample noise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2640-3498,,,,,,2019,89,,,,,,371,379,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000509687900039,0
