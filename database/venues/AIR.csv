Normally, it defines the most important approaches to organizing and making the use of a large volume of information exists in unstructured form. Nowadays, text categorization is becoming an extensively researched field of text mining and processing of languages. Word sense, semantic relationships among terms, text documents and categories are quite essential in order of enhancing the performances of categorization. Various surveys on text categorization have already been available which involve techniques of various text representation schemes to such extent but do not include several approaches that have been explored in text categorization over the standard techniques. Here, an exhaustive analysis of different text categorization approaches over the conventional approaches has been undertaken. This survey paper explores a wide variety of algorithms used for categorizing text documents and tries to assemble the existing works into three basic fields: conventional methods, fuzzy logic-based methods, deep learning-based methods. Further, conventional methods have been categorized into three fields: text categorization using handcrafted features, text categorization using nature-inspired algorithms and text categorization using graph-based methods. Furthermore, this survey provides a clear idea about the available libraries used for different algorithms, availability of datasets, categorization technologies explored in various non-Indian and Indian languages as well.",,,,,"Roy, Kaushik/O-7021-2019","Roy, Kaushik/0000-0002-3360-7576",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,APR,2021.0,54.0,4,,,,,3007.0,3054.0,,10.1007/s10462-020-09919-1,0.0,,SEP 2020,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000574081800001,0

Handwriting recognition has two flavors, namely, Offline Handwriting Recognition and Online Handwriting Recognition. Though, saturation level has been achieved in machine printed (Offline) character recognition. Presently, due to dramatical development in IT sector, touch-based devices are available in the market with efficient processing capabilities. With this revolution, research in the area of handwriting recognition has become more popular in real-time (Online) mode. In this paper, a comprehensive review has been reported for online handwriting recognition of non-Indic and Indic scripts. The six non-Indic-scripts and eight Indic script namely, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Persian, Roman, Thai, and, Assamese, Bangla, Devanagari, Gurmukhi, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, respectively have been considered in this article. This study comprises introduction of online handwriting recognition process, various challenges, motivations, feature extraction, and classification methodologies, used for recognizing the various scripting languages. Moreover, an effort has been made to provide the list of publicly available online handwritten dataset for various scripting languages.

The main concept of the CGO algorithm is based on some principles of chaos theory in which the configuration of fractals by chaos game concept and the fractals self-similarity issues are in perspective. A total number of 239 mathematical functions which are categorized into four different groups are collected to evaluate the overall performance of the presented novel algorithm. In order to evaluate the results of the CGO algorithm, three comparative analysis with different characteristics are conducted. In the first step, six different metaheuristic algorithms are selected from the literature while the minimum, mean and standard deviation values alongside the number of function evaluations for the CGO and these algorithms are calculated and compared. A complete statistical analysis is also conducted in order to provide a valid judgment about the performance of the CGO algorithm. In the second one, the results of the CGO algorithm are compared to some of the recently developed fractal- and chaos-based algorithms. Finally, the performance of the CGO algorithm is compared to some state-of-the-art algorithms in dealing with the state-of-the-art mathematical functions and one of the recent competitions on single objective real-parameter numerical optimization named CEC 2017 is considered as numerical examples for this purpose. In addition, a computational cost analysis is also conducted for the presented algorithm.

It provides a way to increase our understanding of the link between affective and cognitive processes and enhance our interaction with artificial agents. However, the variety of fields contributing to empathy research has resulted in isolated approaches to modeling empathy, and this has led to various definitions of empathy and an absence of common ground regarding underlying empathic processes. Although this diversity may be useful in that it allows for an in-depth examination of various processes linked to empathy, it also may not yet provide a coherent theoretical picture of empathy. We argue that a clear theoretical positioning is required for collective progress. The aim of this article is, therefore, to call for a holistic and multilayered view of a model of empathy, taken from the rich background research from various disciplines. To achieve this, we present a comprehensive background on the theoretical foundations, followed by the working definitions, components, and models of empathy that are proposed by various fields. Following this introduction, we provide a detailed review of the existing techniques used in AI research to model empathy in interactive agents, focusing on the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

CBO has been used to solve various optimization problems because of its simple structure. However, CBO suffers from low convergence speed and premature convergence. To enhance CBO's performance, a new variant named learning strategy based colliding bodies optimization (LSCBO), which is based on the learning strategy of the Teaching-learning-based optimization algorithm (TLBO), is proposed in this paper. In this method, a hybrid strategy combining the colliding process of CBO and the learning process of TLBO is proposed to generate new positions of the bodies. Compared with some other CBO variants, the guidance of the best individual is introduced to improve the convergence speed of CBO, and a random mutation method based on the historic information is designed to help bodies escape from local optima. Moreover, a new method for determining the mass of bodies is designed to avoid computation overflow. To evaluate the effectiveness of LSCBO, 47 benchmark functions and three real-world structural design problems are tested in the simulation experiments, and the results are compared with those of other well-known meta-heuristic algorithms.

In this paper, we have presented a comprehensive survey on character and numeral recognition of non-Indic and Indic scripts. Many researchers have done work on character and numeral recognition from the most recent couple of years. In perspective of this, few strategies for character/numeral have been developed so far. There are an immense number of frameworks available for printed and handwritten character recognition for non-Indic scripts. But, only a limited number of systems are offered for character/numeral recognition of Indic scripts. However, few endeavors have been made on the recognition of Bangla, Devanagari, Gurmukhi, Kannada, Oriya and Tamil scripts. In this paper, we have additionally examined major challenges/issues for character/numeral recognition. The efforts in two directions (non-Indic and Indic scripts) are reflected in this paper. When compared with non-Indic scripts, the research on character recognition of Indic scripts has not achieved that perfection yet. The techniques used for recognition of non-Indic scripts may be used for recognition of Indic scripts (printed/handwritten text) and vice versa to improve the recognition rates.

Ontology learning (OL) from text is a process that aims to (semi-) automatically extract and represent the knowledge from text in machine-readable form. Ontology is considered one of the main cornerstones of representing the knowledge in a more meaningful way on the semantic web. Usage of ontologies has proven to be beneficial and efficient in different applications (e.g. information retrieval, information extraction, and question answering). Nevertheless, manually construction of ontologies is time-consuming as well extremely laborious and costly process. In recent years, many approaches and systems that try to automate the construction of ontologies have been developed.

The hadiths, or Prophetic traditions (tradition for short), are narrations originating from the sayings and conduct of Prophet Muhammad. For Muslims, hadiths are the second most important source of Islamic jurisprudence after the Holy Qur'an. Each hadith consists of two parts, isnad and matn. Matn represents the actual text of the hadith, while isnad unwinds the chain of the authorities which precede and introduce the matn, the succession of people through whose channel the hadith reaches the last transmitter. The hadith corpus is huge and runs into hundreds of volumes. It has an even larger supporting work, e.g., commentaries, biographic material etc. Recently, there has been a renewed interest of this important subject by non-specialists. There are many research studies which have been published regarding hadith, specifically applying computational and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to help address some of the outstanding issues, or derive new insight into this classic resource. This paper surveys all major works that have addressed the subject of hadith through various computational and NLP methods, grouping them under three categories: hadith content-based studies, narration-based studies, and overall studies.

Many online companies rely heavily on analysis of web data to stay in business, to make strategic decisions, and for their existence. One of the problem in analyzing the web data is the web user. A typical web user exhibits highly uncertain pattern of web browsing and the same is captured in form of web server logs. Various data mining techniques like regression, are used to analyze such kind of data, but the inherent complex nature of web data introduces some outlier values while mining for information.

In this paper, we have proposed an approach based on Quantum-Behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) for the LCMST problem. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a well-known population-based swarm intelligence algorithm. Quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) is also proposed by combining the classical PSO philosophy and quantum mechanics to improve performance of PSO. In this paper QPSO has been modified by adding a leaping behavior. When the modified QPSO (MQPSO), falls in to the local optimum, MPSO runs a leaping behavior to leap out the local optimum. We have compared the performance of the proposed method with ML, SCGA, ACO-LCMST, TS-LCMST and ABC-LCMST, which are reported in the literature. Computational results demonstrate the superiority of the MQPSO approach over all the other approaches.

Unlike conventional methods that aggregate multiple attributes to form a composite scalar objective function, evolutionary algorithms with modified reproduction schemes for MO optimization are capable of treating each objective component separately and lead the search in discovering the global Pareto-optimal front. The rapid advances of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, however, poses the difficulty of keeping track of the developments in this field as well as selecting an existing approach that best suits the optimization problem in-hand. This paper thus provides a survey on various evolutionary methods for MO optimization. Many well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithms have been experimented with and compared extensively on four benchmark problems with different MO optimization difficulties. Besides considering the usual performance measures in MO optimization, e.g., the spread across the Pareto-optimal front and the ability to attain the global trade-offs, the paper also presents a few metrics to examine the strength and weakness of each evolutionary approach both quantitatively and qualitatively.

However, due to the shortage of fuel stations providing these types of fuels, careful planning is needed considering the location and time of refueling of vehicles. In this regard, here, it is assumed that vehicles have limited fuel and should go to refueling stations and so fuel stations have also been added to the nodes of the classic vehicle routing problem. In this paper, a mathematical formulation is presented for a green heterogeneous vehicle routing problem and a firefly algorithm is developed to solve it in large-size instances. Two approaches have been used in applying the firefly algorithm. The first approach is the basic firefly algorithm and the second one is the firefly algorithm based on data mining in which the decision tree method reduces solution space and makes smarter fireflies movement. Finally, we have shown that using data mining has a significant effect on improving the performance of the firefly algorithm and by using a decision tree, the efficiency of the algorithm is significantly improved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s10462-022-10336-9,0.0,,NOV 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000889436100004,0

Indeed, to align the sensors spatially for proper data fusion, the calibration process usually involves estimating the extrinsic parameters between them. Traditional LiDAR-camera calibration methods often depend on explicit targets or human intervention, which can be prohibitively expensive and cumbersome. Recognizing these weaknesses, recent methods usually adopt the autonomic targetless calibration approach, which can be conducted at a much lower cost. This paper presents a thorough review of these automatic targetless LiDAR-camera calibration methods. Specifically, based on how the potential cues in the environment are retrieved and utilized in the calibration process, we divide the methods into four categories: information theory based, feature based, ego-motion based, and learning based methods.

Many existing methods based on relation network achieve satisfactory results. However, these methods assume that classes are independent of each other and ignore their relationship. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical few-shot learning model based on coarse- and fine-grained relation network (HCRN), which constructs a hierarchical structure by mining the relationship among different classes. Firstly, we extract deep and shallow features from different layers at a convolutional neural network. The shallow feature information contains more common features among similar classes, while the deep feature information is more specific. The complementary of these different types of data features can effectively construct coarse- and fine-grained structures by clustering. Secondly, we design coarse- and fine-grained relation networks to classify according to the guidance of the hierarchical structure. The hierarchical class structure learned from data is important auxiliary information for classification. Experimental results show that HCRN can outperform several state-of-the-art models on the Omniglot and miniImageNet datasets.

Unlike classical spam email reviews, this one is particularly focused on the problems that this constantly changing environment poses. Moreover, we analyse the different spammer strategies used for contaminating the emails, and we review the state-of-the-art techniques to develop filters based on machine learning.

J,"Rodler, P",,,,"Rodler, Patrick",,,A formal proof and simple explanation of the QuickXplain algorithm,ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW,,,,,,,,,,,,"In his seminal paper of 2004, Ulrich Junker proposed the QuickXplain algorithm, which provides a divide-and-conquer computation strategy to find within a given set an irreducible subset with a particular (monotone) property. Beside its original application in the domain of constraint satisfaction problems, the algorithm has since then found widespread adoption in areas as different as model-based diagnosis, recommender systems, verification, or the Semantic Web. This popularity is due to the frequent occurrence of the problem of finding irreducible subsets on the one hand, and to QuickXplain's general applicability and favorable computational complexity on the other hand. However, although (we regularly experience) people are having a hard time understanding QuickXplain and seeing why it works correctly, a proof of correctness of the algorithm has never been published. This is what we account for in this work, by explaining QuickXplain in a novel tried and tested way and by presenting an intelligible formal proof of it. Apart from showing the correctness of the algorithm and excluding the later detection of errors (proof and trust effect), the added value of the availability of a formal proof is, e.g., (i) that the workings of the algorithm often become completely clear only after studying, verifying and comprehending the proof (didactic effect), (ii) that the shown proof methodology can be used as a guidance for proving other recursive algorithms (transfer effect), and (iii) the possibility of providing gapless correctness proofs of systems that rely on (results computed by) QuickXplain, such as numerous model-based debuggers (completeness effect).",,,,,"Rodler, Patrick/GVT-8547-2022","Rodler, Patrick/0000-0001-8178-4692",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,DEC,2022.0,55.0,8,,,,,6185.0,6206.0,,10.1007/s10462-022-10149-w,0.0,,APR 2022,,,,,,36337611.0,,,,,WOS:000779219200001,0

An enhanced combination of interval-valued m-polar fuzzy (IVmF) sets and soft sets produces this model.

It is closely related to valve functionality which provides vital information for the diagnosis of CVD.

First, PCG signal and its first derivative are decomposed into a set of frequency subbands with a number of decomposition levels by using the tunable Q-factor wavelet transform method. Second, fast and adaptive multivariate empirical mode decomposition decomposes the subbands of the PCG signal and its derivative into scale-aligned intrinsic mode components (IMFs). The first two IMFs are extracted, which contain most of the energy of the PCG signal and its derivative and are considered to be the predominant IMFs. Third, Shannon energy is used to extract the characteristic envelope of predominant IMFs. The properties associated with the nonlinear PCG system dynamics are preserved. They are utilized to derive features, which demonstrate significant difference in PCG system dynamics between normal versus abnormal individual heartbeats. Fourth, neural networks are then used to model, identify and classify PCG system dynamics between normal and abnormal PCG signals based on deterministic learning theory. Finally, experiments have been carried out on a publicly available PCG database to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, which include two types of classification, one for binary classification (normal vs. abnormal) and the other for multi-class classification (normal vs. aortic stenosis vs. mitral regurgitation vs. mitral stenosis vs. mitral valve prolapse). The overall average accuracy for binary, four-class and five-class classification are reported to be 97.75, 98.69 and 98.48%, respectively. The proposed method has obtained the highest overall accuracy in comparison to other state-of-the-art approaches using the same database, which can serve as an assistant diagnostic tool for the automated detection of HVDs in clinical applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,DEC,2021.0,54.0,8,,,,,6063.0,6100.0,,10.1007/s10462-021-09969-z,0.0,,FEB 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000619389200001,0

We conclude three key tasks during vision-based robotic grasping, which are object localization, object pose estimation and grasp estimation. In detail, the object localization task contains object localization without classification, object detection and object instance segmentation. This task provides the regions of the target object in the input data. The object pose estimation task mainly refers to estimating the 6D object pose and includes correspondence-based methods, template-based methods and voting-based methods, which affords the generation of grasp poses for known objects. The grasp estimation task includes 2D planar grasp methods and 6DoF grasp methods, where the former is constrained to grasp from one direction. These three tasks could accomplish the robotic grasping with different combinations. Lots of object pose estimation methods need not object localization, and they conduct object localization and object pose estimation jointly. Lots of grasp estimation methods need not object localization and object pose estimation, and they conduct grasp estimation in an end-to-end manner.

This paper presents an improved hybrid learning strategy that features parameterized genetic algorithms (GAs) to learn the structure of BNs underlying a set of data samples. The performance of GAs is influenced by the choice of multiple initial parameters. This work is concerned with designing a series of parameter-less hybrid methods on a build-up basis: first the standard implementation is refined with the previously-developed data-informed evolutionary strategies. Then, two novel knowledge-driven parent controlling enhancements are presented. The first improvement works upon the parent limitation setting. BN structure learning algorithms typically set a bound for the maximum number of parents a BN node can possess to comply with the computational feasibility of the learning process. Our proposed method carefully selects the parents to rule out based on a knowledge-driven strategy. The second enhancement aims at reducing the sensitivity of the parent control setting by dynamically adjusting the maximum number of parents each node can hold. In the experimental section, it is shown how the adopted baseline outperforms the competitor algorithms included in the benchmark: thanks to its global search capabilities, the genetic methodology can efficiently prevail over other state-of-the-art structural learners on large networks.

Nonetheless, it is difficult to detect the subtle and vital differences in EEG simply by visual inspection because of the non-stationary nature of EEG signals. Specifically, in order to find the epileptogenic focus for medical treatment in the case of a partial epilepsy, an intelligent system that can accurately and automatically detect and discriminate focal and non focal groups of EEG signals is required. This will assist clinicians in locating epileptogenic foci before surgery. In this study we propose a novel method for classification between focal and non focal EEG signals based upon empirical mode decomposition (EMD), phase space reconstruction (PSR) and neural networks. First, EEG signals are decomposed into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) using EMD, and the third and fourth IMFs components are extracted which contain most of the EEG signals' energy and are considered to be the predominant IMFs. Second, phase space of the two IMFs componets is reconstructed, in which the properties associated with the EEG system dynamics are preserved. Three-dimensional (3D) PSR together with Euclidean distance has been utilized to derive features, which demonstrate significant difference in EEG system dynamics between the focal and non focal groups of EEG signals. Third, neural networks are then used as the classifier with feature vectors as the input to distinguish between focal and non focal EEG signals based on the difference of system dynamics between the two groups. Finally, experiments are carried out on the Bern Barcelona database to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method. By using the 10-fold cross-validation style, the achieved accuracy on the 50 pairs and 3750 pairs of EEG signals is reported to be 96% and 95.37%, respectively.

This article presents and analyses different aspects of novelty detection in data streams, like the offline and online phases, the number of classes considered at each phase, the use of ensemble versus a single classifier, supervised and unsupervised approaches for the learning task, information used for decision model update, forgetting mechanisms for outdated concepts, concept drift treatment, how to distinguish noise and outliers from novelty concepts, classification strategies for data with unknown label, and how to deal with recurring classes.

Such environments should comply to ubiquitous or pervasive computing guidelines by sensing the user needs or wishes and offering intuitive human-computer interaction and a comfortable non-intrusive experience. To achieve this goal service orientation is widely used and tightly linked with AmI systems. Some of these employ the Web Service technology, which involves well-defined web technologies and standards that facilitate interoperable machine to machine interaction. Other systems regard services of different technologies (e.g. UPnP, OSGi etc) or generally as abstractions of various actions. Service operations are sometimes implemented as software based functions or actions over hardware equipment (e.g. UPnP players). However, a single service satisfies an atomic only user need, so services need to be composed (i.e. combined), in order to provide the usually requested complex tasks. Since manual service composition is obviously a hassle for the user, ambient systems struggle to automate this process by applying various methods. The approaches that have been adopted during the last years vary widely in many aspects, like domain of application, modeling of services, composition method, knowledge representation and interfaces.

In this paper, we focus on the algorithms that have high efficiency to fill-in the corrupted patches. On the other hand, we also present a new way of detecting the horizontal and vertical gradients especially, in the un-smooth patches. This improves the edge detector filter. Ultimately, a novel scheme for vertical and horizontal interpolation between the corrupted pixels and the non-corrupted adjacent pixels is achieved by improving the efficiency of filling-in. We used a new technique known as the wave-net model. This model combines the wavelet with the neural network classifier (NNC).

An objective model world is described by defining a set of labels ordered in a hierarchy by means of a Cellular Frame knowledge representation. The existence reliability of each label is determined for each location of an array in the Frame. It is determined by a state equation whose initial condition is given by an input primitive label-pattern. The state equation is of the form of local, parallel and iterative computation. The computational process described by the state equation is considered as a process of aggregation (based on input label patterns) of label knowledge introduced for the model description. In this paper, the model description of the Cellular Frame is discussed from two viewpoints: (1) label hierarchy and (2) graphical interpretation of the model. Convergence of the labelling process is ensured by the fact that the state equation always converges.

To plan everyday activities, an agent has to be capable of representing and reasoning about change. However, as it is impossible exhaustively to represent conditions for performing actions and their corresponding effects, artificial systems have to reason without complete knowledge. On the other hand, the fact that in the macroscopic world most characteristics of things persist over time has to be introduced in the formalization of change, to avoid stating explicitly what characteristics of the world are unaffected by every action. These are the main difficulties in planning in a commonsense framework, as far as formalization aspects are concerned. However there are others, of a more pragmatic nature (e.g. managing search).

The inherent vagueness in the fuzzy sets allows researchers to construct various definitions of the fuzzy boundary. The fuzzy boundary is not only crucial for the theoretical purpose, it is also used to express uncertain geographical objects in geographical information systems (GIS). Specifically, the fuzzy boundary is used for constructing algebraic models such as fuzzy 9 and 16-intersection matrices, which evaluate the topological relation between two uncertain geographical objects. Considering that, this paper analyzes the concept of the fuzzy boundary of a set in the fuzzy topological space.

It has various applications in many different fields such as mobile robots, augmented and virtual reality, medical imaging, image-guided surgery systems, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The computational complexity of SLAM algorithms is very high. Therefore, in many applications, it is necessary to implement them in real-time on platforms with low power consumption and small sizes. This paper reviews the implementation and the performance of SLAM algorithms on various platforms. Although there are various review studies on SLAM algorithms, the studies assessing the hardware implementation of these algorithms are very limited. This study attempts to fill this gap. It is shown that using the hardware-software (HW/SW) co-design approaches over mere Software (SW) or hardware (HW) approaches is currently the primary option for implementing SLAM algorithms on hardware platforms. A combination of a hardware accelerator and a software approach increases the speed of the implementation as well as the performance and the speed of the algorithm. Also, dividing different parts of the algorithm according to the structure and the nature of the algorithm between hardware and software in the HW/SW co-design approaches reduces the resource consumption and the cost.

The main purpose of this study is to provide a comprehensive vision by reviewing a set of 43 papers about applications of Deep Learning (DL) methods to the SCM, as well as the trends, perspectives, and potential research gaps. This review uses content analysis to answer three research questions namely: 1- What SCM problems have been solved by the use of DL techniques? 2- What DL algorithms have been used to solve these problems? 3- What alternative algorithms have been used to tackle the same problems? And do DL outperform these methods and through which evaluation metrics? This review also responds to this call by developing a conceptual framework in a value-adding perspective that provides a full picture of areas on where and how DL can be applied within the SCM context.

Evaluating such a complex system in a holistic way can therefore be challenging, as it requires (i) the assessment of the quality of the different learning components, and (ii) the quality perception of the system as a whole by users. Thus, a mixed methods approach is often required, which may combine objective (computational) and subjective (perception-oriented) evaluation techniques.

Threshold segmentation is one of the most popular image segmentation techniques. The traditional methods for finding the optimum threshold are computationally expensive, tedious, and may be inaccurate. Hence, this paper proposes an Improved Whale Optimization Algorithm (IWOA) based on Kapur's entropy for solving multi-threshold segmentation of the gray level image. Also, IWOA supports its performance using linearly convergence increasing and local minima avoidance technique (LCMA), and ranking-based updating method (RUM). LCMA technique accelerates the convergence speed of the solutions toward the optimal solution and tries to avoid the local minima problem that may fall within the optimization process. To do that, it updates randomly the positions of the worst solutions to be near to the best solution and at the same time randomly within the search space according to a certain probability to avoid stuck into local minima. Because of the randomization process used in LCMA for updating the solutions toward the best solutions, a huge number of the solutions around the best are skipped. Therefore, the RUM is used to replace the unbeneficial solution with a novel updating scheme to cover this problem. We compare IWOA with another seven algorithms using a set of well-known test images.

The roughness, accuracy and approximation accuracy are effective evaluations of uncertainty measure based on the lower and upper approximation sets in the classical rough set. However, due to the lack of consideration of the size of the granularity and the granulation distribution of approximation sets, the classical uncertainty measures and its improved methods still have suffered from some shortcomings, such as inaccurate measurement in some special cases, inconsistent with people's cognition and so on, which motivate the study in this paper. In view of the fact that the upper and lower approximation sets are the basic concepts which are used to express the imprecision of knowledge. The paper introduces a more appropriate measure for evaluating the uncertainty, which combines the granularity of knowledge, the cardinality of the lower and upper approximation sets and the granularity distribution of the lower and upper approximation sets. Firstly, the roughness and accuracy based on the granularity distribution of the approximation sets are proposed, and the corresponding properties of the new roughness and accuracy are discussed. Two types of definitions of the approximation accuracy are investigated in the decision systems and their some properties are induced. Theoretical analyses indicate that the proposed measurements can be used to reasonably evaluate the uncertainty of information systems and decision systems.

The algorithm N-US under samples the dataset to maximize the visibility of minority data points while restricting the excessive elimination of majority data points to avoid information loss. To assess the applicability of N-US, it is compared with three standard under-sampling techniques. Further, this study investigates the performance of N-US as a trusted ally for SDP classifiers. Extensive experiments are conducted using benchmark datasets from NASA repository which are CM1, JM1, KC1, KC2 and PC1. The proposed SDP classifier with N-US technique is compared with baseline models statistically to assess the effectiveness of N-US algorithm for SDP.

Fuzzy rule interpolation (FRI) supports such reasoning with sparse rule bases where certain observations may not match any existing fuzzy rules, through manipulation of rules that bear similarity with an unmatched observation. This differs from classical rule-based inference that requires direct pattern matching between observations and the given rules. FRI techniques have been continuously investigated for decades, resulting in various types of approach. Traditionally, it is typically assumed that all antecedent attributes in the rules are of equal significance in deriving the consequents. Recent studies have shown significant interest in developing enhanced FRI mechanisms where the rule antecedent attributes are associated with relative weights, signifying their different importance levels in influencing the generation of the conclusion, thereby improving the interpolation performance. This survey presents a systematic review of both traditional and recently developed FRI methodologies, categorised accordingly into two major groups: FRI with non-weighted rules and FRI with weighted rules.

To solve the problem of missing data in multi-source data analysis, completion method for multiview missing data based on multi-manifold regularized non-negative matrix factorization was proposed in this paper. This method was based on the assumption of consistency of the multiview data and an algorithm of multi-manifold regularized non-negative matrix factorization is adopted to obtain homogeneous manifold and global clustering. On this basis, a multiview synergistic discrimination model is built of the non-missing view that referred to the Gaussian mixture model to pre-mark the clustering that the incremental missing data belonged to. Using the consistency of each view in the low-dimensional space, a prediction model of missing data at the specified view is established using the multiple linear regression technique to achieve accurate data completion under conditions of missing multi-attributes. Through the establishment of data filling model with three handling methods for missing values, namely CMMD-MNMF, FIMUS and Hot deck, the completion performance, clustering performance and classification performance of data sets including UCI, Flower17 and Flower102 are analyzed by simulation experiments. As shown in the results, the method of multi-view data missing completion is verified to be effective.",,,,,"zhang, qiu/GXG-5600-2022","Sun, Jing-tao/0000-0002-8837-7405",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,OCT,2020.0,53.0,7,,,,,5411.0,5428.0,,10.1007/s10462-020-09824-7,0.0,,MAR 2020,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000562488600001,0

It has been proved that SHO can provide competitive results in comparison to other well-known metaheuristics on various optimization problems. Like other metaheuristic algorithms, the main problem faced by the SHO is that it may easily get trapped into local optimal solutions, creating low precision and slow convergence speeds. Therefore, in order to enhance the global convergence speeds, and to obtain better performance, chaotic search have been augmented to searching process of SHO. Various chaotic maps were considered in the proposed Chaotic Selfish Herd Optimizer (CSHO) algorithm in order to replace the value of survival parameter of each searching agent which assists in controlling both exploration and exploitation. The performance of the proposed CSHO is compared with recent high performing meta-heuristics on 13 benchmark functions having unimodal and multimodal properties. Additionally the performance of CSHO as a feature selection approach is compared with various state-of-the-art feature selection approaches.

For Peircean semiotics, a sign is not a dyadic entity, composed of a word and its meaning. Instead, meaning-making is a process of signification borne out of a strictly triadic relationship; in which a representative of a sign (word(s)) stands for its object (or meaning,) but never in a vacuum, and always for an interpretant. For Peirce, it is this third, this interpretant, through which the sign displays its meaning. What is even more important is that this rational process of signification is never being carried out by a single Mind, it requires a community of reasoners. In semiotic terms this article translates the sentiment analysis problem as follows: A sentence/comment is a representamen which has a sentiment value (its object) for an evolving community of reasoning agents (interpretant.) This article presents an interactive multi-agent system in which the agents implicitly model other agents, with a semiotic based approach towards sentiment analysis.

The result of evaluation on the classification method reveals that neural networks classify the Hadith with 94% accuracy. This is because neural networks are capable of handling complex (high dimensional) input data. The Hadith mining method that combines vector space model, Cosine similarity, and enriched queries obtains the best accuracy result (i.e. 88%) among other re-evaluated Hadith mining methods.

Multicast is the transmission of information from one source to multiple destinations simultaneously. Given a multicast request in a WDM network, the goal is to find a set of light-trees, the assigned wavelengths of light-trees, and construct a light-forest. In this paper, the Minimal cost multicast routing problem (MCMRP) on WDM networks with Tap-and-continue nodes is defined and studied. A new cost model which consists of thewavelength usage and communication cost is defined. The objective is to minimize the sum of the cost of used wavelengths and the communication cost of the light-forest. Specifically, the formulation for the WDM multicast routing problem is given. Because the MCMRP is NP-hard, two genetic algorithms (GAs) are proposed to solve this problem. In the proposed GAs, a path-oriented encoding chromosome is used to represent the routing paths.

The final understanding of the picture and caption reflects a consolidation of the information obtained from each of the two sources and can thus be used in intelligent information retrieval tasks. The problem of building a general-purpose computer vision system without a priori knowledge is very difficult at best. The concept of using collateral information in scene understanding has been explored in systems that use general scene context in the task of object identification. The work described here extends this notion by incorporating picture specific information. A multi-stage system FICTION which uses captions to identify humans in an accompanying photograph is described. This provides a computationally less expensive alternative to traditional methods of face recognition. A key component of the system is the utilisation of spatial and characteristic constraints (derived from the caption) in labeling face candidates (generated by a face locator).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,,,,,,1995.0,8.0,5-6,,,,,409.0,430.0,,10.1007/BF00849728,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1995QT72500005,0

The identification of faults often relies on the analysis of real-time data provided by streams and unstructured sources. Ontologies have been applied to the maintenance field in order to add a semantic layer to the data and facilitate interoperability, and combined with other approaches for explainability and fault diagnosis, among others. In such a time-sensitive domain, it is important that ontologies go beyond static representations of the domain and allow not only for the incorporation of time related knowledge, but must also be able to adapt to new knowledge and evolve. This systematic review presents four research questions to provide a general understanding of the state of the art of the representation of time and ontology evolution in the predictive maintenance field. The results have shown that there are several ways of representing the evolution of knowledge that are fairly established and several specific evolutionary actions are discriminated and analyzed. Similarly, there is a diverse group of metrics that can be exploited to measure change and to establish evolutionary trends and even predict future stages of the ontology.

Active learning provides a cost-effective means for creating training data by selecting the most informative instances for labeling. Labels in real applications are often collected from crowdsourcing, which engages online crowds for data labeling at scale. Despite the importance of using crowdsourced data in the active learning process, an analysis of how the existing active learning approaches behave over crowdsourced data is currently missing. This paper aims to fill this gap by reviewing the existing active learning approaches and then testing a set of benchmarking ones on crowdsourced datasets. We provide a comprehensive and systematic survey of the recent research on active learning in the hybrid human-machine classification setting, where crowd workers contribute labels (often noisy) to either directly classify data instances or to train machine learning models. We identify three categories of state of the art active learning methods according to whether and how predefined queries employed for data sampling, namely fixed-strategy approaches, dynamic-strategy approaches, and strategy-free approaches. We then conduct an empirical study on their cost-effectiveness, showing that the performance of the existing active learning approaches is affected by many factors in hybrid classification contexts, such as the noise level of data, label fusion technique used, and the specific characteristics of the task. Finally, we discuss challenges and identify potential directions to design active learning strategies for hybrid classification problems.",,,,,,"Sayin, Burcu/0000-0001-6804-127X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,OCT,2021.0,54.0,7,,,,,5283.0,5305.0,,10.1007/s10462-021-10021-3,0.0,,MAY 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000656081400001,0

As large amounts of data can be collected efficiently and economically, data-driven methods based on deep learning have achieved remarkable results of fault diagnosis of complex systems due to their superiority in feature extraction. However, existing techniques rarely consider time delay of occurrence of faults, which affects the performance of fault diagnosis. In this paper, by synthetically considering feature extraction and time delay of occurrence of faults, we propose a novel fault diagnosis method that consists of two parts, namely, sliding window processing and CNN-LSTM model based on a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM). Firstly, samples obtained from multivariate time series by the sliding window processing integrates feature information and time delay information. Then, the obtained samples are fed into the proposed CNN-LSTM model including CNN layers and LSTM layers. The CNN layers perform feature learning without relying on prior knowledge. Time delay information is captured with the use of the LSTM layers. The fault diagnosis of the Tennessee Eastman chemical process is addressed, and it is verified that the predictive accuracy and noise sensitivity of fault diagnosis can be greatly improved when the proposed method is applied.

Therefore, the early and precise diagnosis of breast cancer plays a pivotal role to improve the prognosis of patients with this disease. Several studies have developed automated techniques using different medical imaging modalities to predict breast cancer development. However, few review studies are available to recapitulate the existing literature on breast cancer classification. These studies provide an overview of the classification, segmentation, or grading of many cancer types, including breast cancer, by using traditional machine learning approaches through hand-engineered features. This review focuses on breast cancer classification by using medical imaging multimodalities through state-of-the-art artificial deep neural network approaches. It is anticipated to maximize the procedural decision analysis in five aspects, such as types of imaging modalities, datasets and their categories, pre-processing techniques, types of deep neural network, and performance metrics used for breast cancer classification. Forty-nine journal and conference publications from eight academic repositories were methodically selected and carefully reviewed from the perspective of the five aforementioned aspects. In addition, this study provided quantitative, qualitative, and critical analyses of the five aspects. This review showed that mammograms and histopathologic images were mostly used to classify breast cancer. Moreover, about 55% of the selected studies used public datasets, and the remaining used exclusive datasets. Several studies employed augmentation, scaling, and image normalization pre-processing techniques to minimize inconsistencies in breast cancer images. Several types of shallow and deep neural network architecture were employed to classify breast cancer using images. The convolutional neural network was utilized frequently to construct an effective breast cancer classification model. Some of the selected studies employed a pre-trained network or developed new deep neural networks to classify breast cancer. Most of the selected studies used accuracy and area-under-the-curve metrics followed by sensitivity, precision, and F-measure metrics to evaluate the performance of the developed breast cancer classification models.

Our findings show that embedding SMOTE into boosting and bagging algorithms is better than preprocessing data using SMOTE before learning the classifier. According to the sensitivity analysis, research and development expense is the most significant predictor of firm failure followed by net sales and total revenue. Our results can be used by managers as a decision support tool to identify high-risk firms at an early stage and take the necessary actions to prevent a firm from failing. The early prediction of firm failure will allow software firms to modularize their products or services into specific features and offer them as digital services using new business models or combine these services with partner firms' services to create new products and address evolving customer expectations. Moreover, the early prediction of firm failure in the software industry calls on firms, both new and those in the growth stage, to componentize their design for adaptability and to build agility in the way firms use their resource mix to address both market gaps as well as operational gaps.",,,,,,"Nwankpa, Joseph/0000-0001-5711-8411",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,AUG,2020.0,53.0,6,,,,,4161.0,4182.0,,10.1007/s10462-019-09789-2,0.0,,NOV 2019,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000541646200002,0

We tackle the problem of Arabic NER using deep learning based on Arabic word embeddings that capture syntactic and semantic relationships between words. Deep learning has been shown to perform significantly better than other approaches for various NLP tasks including NER. However, deep-learning models also require a significantly large amount of training data, which is highly lacking in the case of the Arabic language. To remedy this, we adopt the semi-supervised co-training approach to the realm of deep learning, which we refer to as deep co-learning. Our deep co-learning approach makes use of a small amount of labeled data, which is augmented with partially labeled data that is automatically generated from Wikipedia. Our approach relies only on word embeddings as features and does not involve any additional feature engineering. Nonetheless, when tested on three different Arabic NER benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art Arabic NER approaches, including ones that employ carefully-crafted NLP features. It also consistently outperforms various baselines including purely-supervised deep-learning approaches as well as semi-supervised ones that make use of only unlabeled data such as self-learning and the traditional co-training approach.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,JUN,2019.0,52.0,1,,,,,197.0,215.0,,10.1007/s10462-019-09688-6,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000468576800007,0

Traditional literature on innovation diffusion has been dominated by models of aggregate behavior and trends. However, the agent-based modeling (ABM) paradigm is gaining popularity as it captures agent heterogeneity and enables fine-grained modeling of interactions mediated by social and geographic networks. While most ABM work on innovation diffusion is theoretical, empirically grounded models are increasingly important, particularly in guiding policy decisions. We present a critical review of empirically grounded agent-based models of innovation diffusion, developing a categorization of this research based on types of agent models as well as applications. By connecting the modeling methodologies in the fields of information and innovation diffusion, we suggest that the maximum likelihood estimation framework widely used in the former is a promising paradigm for calibration of agent-based models for innovation diffusion.

BA can be divided into four parts: parameter tuning, initialization, local search, and global search. Since its invention, several studies have sought to enhance the performance of BA by improving some of its parts. Thus, more than one version of the algorithm has been proposed. However, upon searching for the basic version of BA in the literature, unclear and contradictory information can be found. By reviewing the literature and conducting some experiments on a set of standard benchmark functions, three main implementations of the algorithm that researchers should be aware of while working on improving the BA are uncovered. These implementations are Basic BA, Shrinking-based BA and Standard BA. Shrinking-based BA employs a shrinking procedure, and Standard BA uses a site abandonment approach in addition to the shrinking procedure. Thus, various implementations of the shrinking and site-abandonment procedures are explored and incorporated into BA to constitute different BA implementations. This paper proposes a framework of the main implementations of BA, including Basic BA and Standard BA, to give a clear picture of these implementations and the relationships among them. Additionally, the experiments show no significant differences among most of the shrinking implementations.

Over the past decade, ELMs have successfully been applied to a wide range of regression and classification problems. However, in most of the reports, classical learning systems have been used for training ELMs which can result in cumbersome mathematical formulations and unstable solutions when handling large databases. Moreover, there is no guarantee for converging to global optimum solutions when traditional methods are used for the regularized learning of ELMs, especially when the variables in the database are correlated. To cope with such flaws, some researchers have used bio-inspired computation (BIC) for the topology evolving and parameter tuning of ELMs. However, the research stream still experiences its infancy. In an attempt to take a significant stride towards fulfilling the existing gap, the authors conduct a comprehensive analysis by adopting different BIC and classical methods for training ELMs. Based on the simulation results, some recommendations are given to guide researchers on using appropriate BICs for ELM training for small-scale, medium-scale, large-scale and very large-scale regression and classification problems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,AUG,2016.0,46.0,2,,,,,167.0,223.0,,10.1007/s10462-016-9461-2,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000379026000002,0

Numerical results show that, when associated to the exponential crossover, the employment of multiple scale factors is not systematically beneficial and in some cases even detrimental to the performance of the algorithm. The exponential crossover accentuates the exploitative character of the Differential Evolution, which cannot always be counterbalanced by the increase in the explorative aspect of the algorithm introduced by the employment of multiple scale factor values.",,,,,"Neri, Ferrante/U-7036-2019; Neri, Ferrante/C-8306-2014","Neri, Ferrante/0000-0002-6100-6532; Neri, Ferrante/0000-0002-6100-6532",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,MAR,2013.0,39.0,3,,,,,195.0,224.0,,10.1007/s10462-011-9267-1,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000315591000002,0

They help automate the filmmaking process even by non professionals without or with minimal intervention of animators and computer graphics programmers. Based on specified cinematographic principles and filming rules, they plan the sequence of virtual cameras that the best render a 3D scene. In this paper, we present an approach for automatic movie generation using linear temporal logic to express these filming and cinematography rules. We consider the filming of a 3D scene as a sequence of shots satisfying given filming rules, conveying constraints on the desirable configuration (position, orientation, and zoom) of virtual cameras. The selection of camera configurations at different points in time is understood as a camera plan, which is computed using a temporal-logic based planning system (TLPlan) to obtain a 3D movie. The camera planner is used within an automated planning application for generating 3D tasks demonstrations involving a teleoperated robot arm on the the International Space Station (ISS). A typical task demonstration involves moving the robot arm from one configuration to another. The main challenge is to automatically plan the configurations of virtual cameras to film the arm in a manner that conveys the best awareness of the robot trajectory to the user. The robot trajectory is generated using a path-planner. The camera planner is then invoked to find a sequence of configurations of virtual cameras to film the trajectory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,APR,2012.0,37.0,4,,,,,313.0,330.0,,10.1007/s10462-011-9233-y,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000301542600004,0

However, mobile devices are inherently constrained in their computational power and battery capacity making them mere dumb terminals connected to a resource-rich pervasive environment. If they are ever to play a more prominent role as true elements of a pervasive environment, mobile devices must be able to embed more application logic and delegate processing requests to pervasive infrastructure. In this paper we discuss distribution and offloading of computationally intensive tasks in pervasive environments populated by mobile devices. This approach is illustrated by experimenting with a distributed version of iterative deepening A* search algorithm. In our approach, the solution space of a problem being solved is partitioned and distributed among heterogeneous mobile devices, which yields a significant increase in the time of finding an optimal solution. Distributed IDA* search algorithm does not require any coordination or communication between mobile devices, but added inter-processor communication through shared memory further increases the efficiency of the algorithm.

We describe the ECUE system, which classifies emails using a feature-based form of textual CBR. Then, we describe an alternative way to compute the distances between cases in a feature-free fashion, using a distance measure based on text compression. This distance measure has the advantages of having no set-up costs and being resilient to concept drift. We report an empirical comparison, which shows the feature-free approach to be more accurate than the feature-based system. These results are fairly robust over different compression algorithms in that we find that the accuracy when using a Lempel-Ziv compressor (GZip) is approximately the same as when using a statistical compressor (PPM). We note, however, that the feature-free systems take much longer to classify emails than the feature-based system. Improvements in the classification time of both kinds of systems can be obtained by applying case base editing algorithms, which aim to remove noisy and redundant cases from a case base while maintaining, or even improving, generalisation accuracy.

The definitions of coherence and inference-making in this paper incorporate some of this work in cognitive psychology. Three major research methodologies are examined in the light of these definitions: scripts, spreading activation, and abduction. This analysis highlights several deficiencies in current models of comprehension. One deficiency of concern is the 'one-track' behaviour of current systems, which pursue a monostratal representation of each story. In contrast, this paper emphasises a view of adaptive comprehension which produces a 'variable-depth' representation. A representation is pursued to the extent specified by the comprehender's goals; these goals determine the amount of coherence sought by the system, and hence the 'depth' of its representation.

In existing three-way decision models, all objects can be divided into two states, we utilize decision attributes to obtain the set of two states in ordered decision information systems. Then, in order to improve the accuracy of patient classifications, the paper simultaneously considers the influence of loss and gain functions for each object, and uses loss and gain functions to obtain net profit functions as new measurement functions. Meanwhile, a class of three-way decisions in terms of multi-attribute decision making rules based on a tolerance dominance relation is established.

To solve that problem, we must carefully examine the relationship between the depth of architecture, input parameters, and the model's accuracy. The evolutionary algorithms are prominent in solving the challenges in architecture design and parameter selection. However, the adoption of evolutionary algorithms itself is a challenging task as the computation cost increases with its evolution. The performance of evolutionary algorithms depends on the type of encoding technique used to represent a CNN architecture. In this article, we presented a comprehensive study of the recent approaches involved in the design and training of CNN architecture. The advantages and disadvantages of selecting a CNN architecture using evolutionary algorithms are discussed. The manual architecture is compared against automated CNN architecture based on the accuracy and range of parameters in the existing benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we have discussed the ongoing issues and challenges involved in evolutionary algorithms-based CNN architecture design.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s10462-022-10303-4,0.0,,OCT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000871874800001,0

Many data-driven methods have been developed for machinery diagnostics and prognostics. However, there lacks sufficient labeled data to train a high-performance data-driven model. Moreover, machinery datasets are usually collected from different operation conditions and mechanical components, leading to poor model generalization. To address these concerns, cross-domain transfer learning methods are applied to enhance the feasibility and accuracy of data-driven methods for machinery diagnostics and prognostics. This paper presents a comprehensive survey about how recent studies apply diverse transfer learning methods into machinery tasks including diagnostics and prognostics. Three types of commonly-used transfer methods, i.e., model and parameter transfer, feature matching and adversarial adaptation, are systematically summarized and elaborated on their main ideas, typical models and corresponding representative studies on machinery diagnostics and prognostics. In addition, ten widely-used open-source machinery datasets are presented. Based on recent research progress, this survey expounds emerging challenges and future research directions of transfer learning for industrial applications.

Traditional artificial neural networks can simulate IL, but there are some shortcomings. A few years ago, people used a morphological neural network (MNN) to simulate IL, but the support in theory and practice is weak. The contribution of this study is threefold. Firstly, based on the theory of unified framework of morphological associative memories (UFMAM), this paper makes a deep exploration for simulating IL by MNNs. Since both MNN and UFMAM are based on strict mathematical morphology, the research is established on a solid theoretical basis. Secondly, three experiments were designed, and the results were analyzed and discussed according to the theory of UFMAM. Thus, the depth and breadth of this research of IL were further expanded, new simulation methods and research examples were provided, and the MNN model of IL was established. Thirdly, it provides an example for the coordinated development of artificial neural networks, artificial intelligence, cognitive psychology, neural science and brain science. The research shows that the IL model based on MNN is superior to the traditional IL model in automation, comprehension, abstraction and anti-interference. Therefore, it will play an important role in the future study of IL and bring new inspiration to reveal the neural mechanism of IL. There is an inseparable relationship between MNN and IL, i.e. the former provides new research tools and means for the latter, while the latter provides psychological and neuroscientific supports for the former, which will make both of them have a more solid scientific foundation.

The essence of the proposed Q-SCA is to speed up the optimum searching operation and to accelerate the convergence characteristic. The proposed Q-SCA works in twofold: firstly, an improved version of SCA based on tuning the search space around the destination solution dynamically, so that the search space is shrunken gradually as the optima are attained. In addition, a new mechanism to update the solutions is introduced using bidirectional equations. Secondly, QLS is incorporated to improve the quality of the obtained solutions by the SCA phase. By this methodology, the proposed Q-SCA can achieve high levels of exploration/exploitation and precise stable convergence to high-quality solutions.

Specifically, agents will become more risk averse (or more risk seeking) if their game payoffs exceed (or fall below) their expectations. In particular, agents use their peers' average payoffs as expectations (social comparison) when their payoffs are lower than their peers' averages, but use their own historical payoffs as expectations (historical comparison) when their payoffs are higher than their peers' averages. Such selective attention to social comparison or historical comparison manifests a desire for continuous improvement of agents. Simulations are conducted to investigate the evolution of cooperation under the selective attention mechanism. Results indicate that agents can sustain a highly cooperative equilibrium when they consider selective attention in adjusting their risk attitudes. This holds true for both the well-mixed and the network-based games, even in the presence of uncertain game payoffs. The reason is that, selective attention can significantly induce agents to adhere to conditional cooperation as well as to identify uncertainty in payoffs, which enhances the risk-averse behavior of agents in the IPD game. As a result, high levels of cooperation can be attained.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,DEC,2020.0,53.0,8,,,,,6043.0,6078.0,,10.1007/s10462-020-09842-5,0.0,,MAY 2020,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000533172600001,0

In this model, concepts are approximated through substitution of a partition in classical rough set theory with a covering in covering-based rough set theory. Various generalized covering-based rough sets have been investigated, however, little work has been done on extending four classical covering-based rough set to intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) settings. In this study, four novel IF covering-based rough set models are developed by combining an IF beta-covering with four classical covering-based rough set models. First, we present the concept of IF beta-minimal description, and then construct four order relations on IF beta approximation space. Second, we propose four IF beta-covering-based rough set models and derive that they are generalizations of four existing covering-based rough sets in IF settings. We also discuss the properties of these IF beta-covering-based rough sets and reveal their relationships. We use the existing distance between two IF sets to characterize the uncertainty of the presented IF beta-covering-based rough sets. Third, we define the reducts of IF beta-covering decision systems and examine their discernibility-function-based reduction methods for these IF beta-covering-based rough sets.

Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to draw attention to the attribute reducts of multi-granulation information system. For any subset of information system, we usually characterize it by its upper and lower approximations. In order to calculate the upper and lower approximations faster, we must reduce the redundant information of the information system. According to the preceding analysis, we first introduce three types of attribute reduct, which are called arbitrary union reduct, neighborhood union reduct and neighborhood intersection reduct, respectively. Then many basic and important results of these reducts are deeply explored. In order to apply the theories of attribute reducts to deal with practical issues, we develop three algorithms so as to compute multi-granulation upper and lower approximations.

Organisations, governments and individuals are creating increasingly large data sources, and in many cases making them publicly available. This offers massive potential for interaction and mutual collaboration. But using this data often creates problems. Those creating the data will use their own terminology, structure and formats for the data, meaning that data from one source will be incompatible with data from another source. When presented with a large, unknown data source, it is very difficult to ascribe meaning to the terms of that data source, and to understand what is being conveyed. Much effort has been invested in data interpretation prior to run-time, with large data sources being matched against each other off-line. But data is often used dynamically, and so to maximise the value of the data it is necessary to extract meaning from it dynamically. We therefore postulate that an essential competent of utilising the world of data in which we increasingly live is the development of the ability to discover meaning on the go in large, heterogenous data.This paper provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art, reviewing the aims and achievements in different fields which can be applied to this problem.

The extraction of precise information is becoming more and more difficult as the volume of data on the internet increases. Several search engines and information fetching tools are available on the internet, all of which claim to provide the best crawling facilities. For the most part, these search engines are keyword based. This poses a problem for visually impaired people who want to get the full use from online resources available to other users. Visually impaired users require special aid to get along with any given computer system. Interface and content management are no exception, and special tools are required to facilitate the extraction of relevant information from the internet for visually impaired users. The HOIEV (Heavyweight Ontology Based Information Extraction for Visually impaired User) architecture provides a mechanism for highly precise information extraction using heavyweight ontology and built-in vocal command system for visually impaired internet users. Our prototype intelligent system not only integrates and communicates among different tools, such as voice command parsers, domain ontology extractors and short message engines, but also introduces an autonomous mechanism of information extraction (IE) using heavyweight ontology.

Today, combining classifiers is proposed as a new road for the improvement of the classification accuracy. However, most ensemble algorithms operate in batch mode. For this reason, we propose an incremental ensemble that combines five classifiers that can operate incrementally: the Naive Bayes, the Averaged One-Dependence Estimators (AODE), the 3-Nearest Neighbors, the Non-Nested Generalised Exemplars (NNGE) and the Kstar algorithms using the voting methodology.

This paper examines a novel particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based scheme to solve dynamic routing and wavelength assignment (dynamic RWA) process needed to provision optical channels for wavelength continuous Wavelength Division Multiplexed (WDM) optical network without any wavelength conversion capability. The proposed PSO scheme employs a novel fitness function which is used during quantization of solutions represented by respective particles of the swarm. The proposed fitness function takes into account the normalized path length of the chosen route and the normalized number of free wavelengths available over the whole route, enabling the PSO-based scheme to be self-tuning by minimizing the need to have a dynamic algorithmic parameter 'alpha' needed for better performance in terms of blocking probability of the connection requests.

The QoS provided by the networks for each application was quantitatively assessed using a fuzzy inference system (FIS). Two methods to improve the networks' QoS were developed. One method was based on a FIS mechanism and the other used a hybrid genetic-fuzzy system. Both methods determined an optimised value for the minimum contention window (CW (min)) in IEEE 802.11 medium access control (MAC) protocol. CW (min) affects the time period a wireless station waits before it transmits a packet and thus its value influences QoS. The average QoS for the audio and video applications improved by 42.8% and 14.5% respectively by using the FIS method.

Those presentation systems which incorporate remote multimedia content accessed across HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) or RTP (Real Time Transfer Protocol) protocols are particularly reliant on the capabilities of the connecting mobile network (i.e. minimum, average and maximum bandwidth) and in particular on the real-time constraints (i.e. currently available bandwidth, packet loss, bit error rate, latency) which prevail during actual content transmission. One approach to address this is to scale content, thus reducing its datarate requirement, although this technique is inherently limited by the lowest acceptable quality of that media element. Alternatively, content can be converted from one modality to another with a lower resource requirement. TeleMorph, a cross-modality adaptation control platform is detailed here. Initially a brief introduction to Intelligent Multimedia and to Mobile Intelligent Multimedia is given, and key systems discussed. The main premise of TeleMorph is that cross-modality adaptations in mobile presentation systems must be controlled in a manner which gives primary consideration to bandwidth fluctuations as well as the constraints listed above. The current prototype of TeleMorph, which uses a fuzzy inference system to control cross-modality adaptations between video and audio, is described. Particular focus is given to the fuzzy inputs, fuzzy control rules and fuzzy outputs which have been utilised in decision making. TeleTuras, a tourist information application which has been implemented as a testbed for TeleMorph, gives promising evaluation results based on multimedia and bandwidth specific test scenarios. TeleMorph is related to other approaches in the area of Mobile Intelligent Multimedia Presentation Systems. TeleMorph differs from other approaches in that it focuses specifically on the challenges posed by controlling bandwidth determined cross-modality adaptations in a mobile network environment. Future work on TeleMorph's output presentation composition will incorporate images and text also, thus allowing for extended adaptation between video, audio, images and text, as well as multimodal combinations of these media elements.",,,,,"Curran, Kevin/AAC-4865-2019","Curran, Kevin/0000-0001-5237-5355",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,DEC,2006.0,26.0,4,,,,,325.0,363.0,,10.1007/s10462-007-9060-3,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000252222700004,0

This optimistic assumption is no longer feasible if NLU is to scale up to deal with text that naturally occurs in the 'real world''. The key issue is robustness: The system needs to be prepared for cases where the input data does not correspond to the expectations encoded in the grammar. In this paper, we survey the approaches towards the robustness problem that have been developed throughout the last decade. We inspect techniques to overcome both syntactically and semantically ill-formed input in sentence parsing and then look briefly into more recent ideas concerning the extraction of information from texts, and the related question of the role that linguistic research plays in this game.

Explainable AI (XAI) techniques are defined to unveil the reasoning behind the system's predictions and decisions, and they become even more critical when dealing with sensitive and personal health data. It is worth noting that XAI has not gathered the same attention across different research areas and data types, especially in healthcare. In particular, many clinical and remote health applications are based on tabular and time series data, respectively, and XAI is not commonly analysed on these data types, while computer vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) are the reference applications. To provide an overview of XAI methods that are most suitable for tabular and time series data in the healthcare domain, this paper provides a review of the literature in the last 5 years, illustrating the type of generated explanations and the efforts provided to evaluate their relevance and quality.

Too large population size leads to slow convergence, while too small population size causes premature convergence and stagnation. To solve this problem, a population reduction with individual similarity (PRS) for DE is proposed in this paper. In the PRS, a linear differential decrease method is used to automatically determine the population size required in each generation. At the same time, the current population is divided into two subgroups with equal sizes according to individual similarity, and the individuals that need to be removed are determined from the subgroup with the lowest individual similarity in an effective manner, and thus the convergence is further accelerated without affecting the population diversity. In addition, an elite-oriented strategy is utilized to replace the random selection of individuals in the original mutation strategy of DE, which provides constructive guidance for individual evolution and improves the convergence quality. Five basic DE and six advanced DE algorithms are used to evaluate the effect of PRS, and it is further compared with four improved DE algorithms with population reduction strategy. The experimental results on CEC 2014 benchmark functions show that the proposed PRS can effectively enhance the performance of these five basic DE and six advanced DE algorithms, and is better than the four population reduction strategies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s10462-022-10264-8,0.0,,SEP 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000854393600002,0

Firstly, point at the multiple information features, an amplitude-frequency-shape based state description form is proposed in this paper. It could analyze the time series from the aspects of energy, phase, and knowledge similarity. In view of the variable number and scale of knowledge fragments, a piecewise linear segmentation criterion is put forward based on the complexity and accuracy of information representation. Then a model free knowledge discovery framework without samples labels is constructed to discover the knowledge quickly and effectively. Aimed at the variable knowledge scale, a variable scale evaluation method is first proposed to distinguish the multi-scale decision-making knowledge based on the indicators of system stability and security. It could optimize the knowledge base and guide the decision-making process. The experimental results on heterogeneous activity datasets indicate that the proposed method here could generally analysis the time series state and discover the knowledge efficiently from massive data.

Occasionally, players are bound to change their predefined strategies as per the requirements of the circumstances in bimatrix game problems. Such irregular incidents provoke decision-makers to modify the payoffs of a bimatrix game. So, to deal with such irregularities, in this paper, we consider the payoffs of a bimatrix game in the form of dense fuzzy lock sets. Initially, considering players' confidence level towards the information, we define a new defuzzification function, viz., weighted average defuzzification function (WADF). Later, we execute an auxiliary dense fuzzy non-linear programming problem to find the nash equilibrium strategies along with the value of the game for each player. Utilizing the proposed WADF, we transform the dense fuzzy non-linear programming problem into an equivalent crisp non-linear programming problem. Then we solve the reduced problem for different trials using the software MATHEMATICA 9.0. There are two vital observations of the present problem. One of them is the gradual increment of the value of the game with the increment of players' confidence level towards the information at a fixed trial. Another fact is the significant changes in the value of the game occurred with the number of trials at a certain confidence level.

Though it has a considerable convergence speed, WOA suffers from diversity in the solution due to the low exploration of search space. As a result, it tends to trap in local optima and suffer from low solution accuracy. This study proposes a novel improved WOA method (ImWOA) with increased diversity in the solution to avoid the aforesaid gaps. The random solution selection process in the search prey phase is altered to increase exploration. The whale's cooperative hunting strategy is also incorporated in the algorithm's exploitation phase to balance the exploration and exploitation phase of WOA. Also, the total iterations are divided into two halves explicitly for exploration and exploitation purposes. The modifications facilitate WOA to jump out of local optima, increase solution accuracy, and increase convergence speed. The experiments were carried out evaluating IEEE CEC 2017 functions in dimensions 10, 30, 50, and 100. The performances were compared with basic algorithms as well as recent WOA variants. Three engineering design problems have also been solved to check its problem-solving ability and compared with a wide range of algorithms.

In this regard, this paper introduces new learning techniques defined opposition-based learning (OBL) and quasi OBL (QOBL) to improve the exploration as well as exploitation manner of the grey wolf optimizer (GWO). The involved approach can enhance the searching behavior of the original GWO against the trapping in local optima.

The suggested MGWO-based AMPC is evaluated with the classical MPC and the adaptive fuzzy logic controller. Furthermore, the inspired MGWO is compared with the original GWO, neural network algorithm (NNA), heap-based optimizer, and equilibrium optimizer in literature.

The index of optimism, lambda=1, is termed as optimistic decision-maker as it considers the value and the ambiguity of the truth-membership function, ignoring the contributions from indeterminacy-membership and falsity-membership functions. Similarly, the index of optimism, lambda=0, is termed as pessimistic decision-maker as it considers the values and the ambiguities of the indeterminacy-membership and falsity-membership functions, ignoring the contribution from truth-membership function. Further, the index of optimism, lambda=0.5, is termed as moderate decision-maker as it considers the values and the ambiguities of all the membership functions. The approach is a novel as it completely oath to follow the reasonable properties of a ranking method. It is worth to mention that the current approach consistently ranks the single-valued neutrosophic numbers as well as their corresponding images.",,,,,,"Chutia, Rituparna/0000-0002-5323-3698",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,FEB,2022.0,55.0,2,,,,,1489.0,1518.0,,10.1007/s10462-021-09981-3,0.0,,APR 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000641209300002,0

Diversity among base classifiers is considered as a key issue in ensemble learning. Recently, to promote the diversity of base classifiers, ensemble methods through multimodal perturbation have been proposed. These methods simultaneously use two or more perturbation techniques when generating base classifiers. In this paper, from the perspective of multi-modal perturbation, we propose an ensemble approach (called 'E_RSRR') based on random super-reduct and resampling. To generate a set of accurate and diverse base classifiers, E_RSRR adopts a new multi-modal perturbation strategy. This strategy combines two perturbation techniques together, that is, resampling and random super-reduct. First, it perturbs the sample space via the resampling technique; Second, it perturbs the feature space via the random super-reduct technique, which is a combination of RSS (random subspace selection) technique and ADEFS (approximate decision entropy-based feature selection) method in rough sets.

Four extensions are introduced: (1) special logic gate and zoom function event variables to represent and quantify the influences of various risk factors on the morbidities of diseases. (2) Reversal logic gate to model the case that some diseases/causes may result in at least two simultaneous symptoms/consequences. (3) Disease-specific manifestation variable for special inference and easy understanding to diagnose a specific disease.

Encoding such constraints to SAT has proved to be an efficient solving approach. A commonly used technique for encoding PB constraints consists in representing the constraint as a Binary Decision Diagram (BDD), and then encoding this BDD to SAT. A key point in this technique is to obtain small BDD representations to generate small SAT formulas. In many problems, some subsets of the Boolean variables occurring in a PB constraint may also have other constraints imposed on them. In this work we introduce a way to take advantage of those constraints in order to obtain smaller SAT encodings. The main idea is that decision diagrams may be smaller if they avoid to represent truth assignments that are already forbidden by some other constraints. In particular, we present encodings for monotonic decreasing PB constraints, in conjunction with other constraints such as at-most-one, exactly-one and implication chains on subsets of their variables.

However, collaborating players need to perform well for the team as a whole to benefit and thus teams often end up performing no better than a strong player would have performed individually. Personalisation offers a means for improving overall performance and engagement, but in collaborative games, personalisation is seldom implemented, and when it is, it is overwhelmingly passive such that the player is not guided to goal states and the effectiveness of the personalisation is not evaluated and adapted accordingly. In this paper, we propose and apply the use of reflective agents to personalisation ('reflective personalisation') in collaborative gaming for individual players within collaborative teams via a combination of individual player and team profiling in order to improve player and thus team performance and engagement. The reflective agents self-evaluate, dynamically adapting their personalisation techniques to most effectively guide players towards specific goal states, match players and form teams. We incorporate this agent-based approach within a microservices architecture, which itself is a set of collaborating services, to facilitate a scalable and portable approach that enables both player and team profiles to persist across multiple games. An experiment involving 90 players over a two-month period was used to comparatively assess three versions of a collaborative game that implemented reflective, guided, and passive personalisation for individual players within teams. Our results suggest that the proposed reflective personalisation approach improves team player performance and engagement within collaborative games over guided or passive personalisation approaches, but that it is especially effective for improving engagement.",,,,,,"Angelides, Marios/0000-0003-3931-4616; Agius, Harry/0000-0002-8818-2683; Daylamani-Zad, Damon/0000-0001-7849-458X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,JAN,2020.0,53.0,1,,,,,429.0,474.0,,10.1007/s10462-018-9665-8,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000511719800013,0

The vision of CRNs as cognitive networks, however, requires that the research focus progresses from its current system-level fixation to the a network-wide optimization focus. This motivates the development of cognitive routing protocols envisioned as routing protocols that fully and seamlessly incorporate artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques into their design.

In some cases, there exists knowledge about the uncertain and dynamic environment. In other cases, this information is unknown or hard to obtain. In this paper, we consider CSPs with discrete and ordered domains where changes only involve restrictions or expansions of domains or constraints.

The weight of each valid tuple is based on its distance from the borders of the space of valid tuples in the corresponding constraint/domain.

At the end of the training phase no Peer will know anything else besides its own local data. This privacy-preserving obligation is a challenging problem for trainable combiners but is crucial in real world applications. Only classifiers are transmitted to other peers to validate their data and send back average accuracy rates in a classical asynchronous peer-to-peer execution cycle. Here the validation set for one classifier becomes the training set of the other and vice versa.

This so called 'mirror neuron' system is thought to underlie our ability to automatically infer the goals and intentions of others by observing their actions. Kilner et al. (Curr Biol 13(6):522-525, 2003) provide evidence for a human 'mirror neuron' system by showing that the execution of simple arm movements is affected by the simultaneous perception of another's movement. Specifically, observation of 'incongruent' movements made by another human, but not by a robotic arm, leads to greater variability in the movement trajectory than observation of movements in the same direction. In this study we ask which aspects of the observed motion are crucial to this interference effect by comparing the efficacy of real human movement to that of sparse 'point-light displays'.

We derive some general properties for this important class of temporal entities, and some properties for an interesting subclass, namely the class of repetition of concatenable entities.

MVL functions are applied in logic design of multi- valued circuits and machine learning applications. Bi- decomposition is a method to decompose a function into two decomposition functions that are connected by a two- input operator called gate. Each of the decomposition functions depends on fewer variables than the original function. Recursive bi- decomposition represents a function as a structure of interconnected gates. For logic synthesis, the type of the gate can be chosen so that it has an efficient hardware representation. For machine learning, gates are selected to represent simple and understandable classification rules. Algorithms are presented for non- disjoint bi- decomposition, where the decomposition functions may share variables with each other. Bi- decomposition is discussed for the min- and max- operators. To describe the MVL bi- decomposition theory, the notion of incompletely specified functions is generalized to function intervals. The application of MVL differential calculus leads to particular efficient algorithms. To ensure complete recursive decomposition, separation is introduced as a new concept to simplify non- decomposable functions. Multi- decomposition is presented as an example of separation. The decomposition algorithms are implemented in a decomposition system called YADE. MVL test functions from logic synthesis and machine learning applications are decomposed. The results are compared to other decomposers. It is verified that YADE finds decompositions of superior quality by bi- decomposition of MVL function sets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,DEC,2003.0,20.0,3-4,,,,,233.0,267.0,,10.1023/B:AIRE.0000006608.31990.cd,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000186971300004,0

In response to it, many feature selection methods have been proposed, including forward sequential selection (FSS) and backward sequential selection (BSS). Although they often produce substantial improvements in accuracy, these methods select the same set of relevant features everywhere in the instance space, and thus represent only a partial solution to the problem. In general, some features will be relevant only in some parts of the space; deleting them may hurt accuracy in those parts, but selecting them will have the same effect in parts where they are irrelevant. This article introduces RC, a new feature selection algorithm that uses a clustering-like approach to select sets of locally relevant features (i.e., the features it selects may vary from one instance to another). Experiments in a large number of domains from the UCI repository show that RC almost always improves accuracy with respect to FSS and BSS, often with high significance, A study using artificial domains confirms the hypothesis that this difference in performance is due to RC's context sensitivity, and also suggests conditions where this sensitivity will and will not be an advantage.

To minimize access time and maximize load balancing for data nodes (DNs), a dynamic data replication algorithm is necessary. Even so, few of the existing algorithms consider each objective holistically during replication. An improved ant lion optimizer (ALO) algorithm and a fuzzy system are used in this paper to determine dynamically the number of replicas and the DNs for replication. Further, it balances the trade-offs among different objectives (e.g., service time, system availability, load, and monetary cost). The ALO algorithm has been widely applied to solve complex optimization problems due to its simplicity in implementation. However, ALO has premature convergence and can thus easily get trapped into the local optimum solution. In this paper, to overcome the shortcomings of ALO by balancing exploration and exploitation, a hybrid ant lion optimizer with Tabu search algorithm (ALO-Tabu) is proposed. There are several improvements of the ALO, in which the appropriate solutions are selected for the initial population based on chaotic maps (CMs) and opposition-based learning (OBL) strategies. On the other hand, there are many CMs, OBLs, and random walk strategies that make it difficult to select the best one for optimization. Generally, they are selected manually, which is time-consuming. As a result, this paper presents a hyper-heuristic ALO (HH-ALO-Tabu) that automatically chooses CMs, OBLs, and random walk strategies depending on the differential evolution (DE) algorithm. Based on 20 well-known test functions, the experiment results and statistical tests show that HH-ALO-Tabu can solve optimization problems effectively.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s10462-022-10309-y,0.0,,NOV 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000886866100006,0

In terms of unsupervised feature selection, the Laplacian score (LS) provides a powerful measurement and optimization method, and good performance has been achieved using the recent forward iterative Laplacian score (FILS) algorithm. However, there is still room for advancement. The aim of this paper is to improve the FILS algorithm, and thus, feature significance (SIG) is mainly introduced to develop a high-quality selection method, i.e., the incremental forward iterative Laplacian score (IFILS) algorithm. Based on the modified LS, the metric difference in the incremental feature process motivates SIG. Therefore, SIG offers a dynamic characterization by considering initial and terminal states, and it promotes the current FILS measurement on only the terminal state. Then, both the modified LS and integrated SIG acquire granulation nonmonotonicity and uncertainty, especially on incremental feature chains, and the corresponding verification is achieved by completing examples and experiments. Furthermore, a SIG-based incremental criterion of minimum selection is designed to choose optimization features, and thus, the IFILS algorithm is naturally formulated to implement unsupervised feature selection. Finally, an in-depth comparison of the IFILS algorithm with the FILS algorithm is achieved using data experiments on multiple datasets, including a nominal dataset of COVID-19 surveillance.

Most of the c-Means algorithms such as FCM (Fuzzy c-Means), IFCM (Intuitionistic Fuzzy c-Means), and the recently reported PIFCM (Probabilistic Intuitionistic Fuzzy c-means) randomly initialize cluster centroids. Performance of these techniques is very reliant on the initialized cluster centroids. So, a good initialization technique can significantly affect the cluster formation. Recently, density-based initialization technique for FCM (DFCM) was proposed, which initializes datapoints with high density as cluster centroids. In DFCM, points within some distance contribute in the density of the data points. In this paper, we propose a new way to compute fuzzy density of datapoints based on the distance measure. Uncertainty can be better captured by intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) and interval-valued IFS (IVIFS). Thus, we propose a new density-based initialization technique for IFCM, called 'Density based Intuitionistic Fuzzy c-Means (DIFCM) Algorithm'. The proposed DIFCM has been further developed for IVIFS, which we term 'Interval-valued Density based Intuitionistic Fuzzy c-Means (IVDIFCM) Algorithm', is also introduced in this paper.

Recently, a new type of preference relation called linguistic preference relations with self-confidence (LPRs-SC) has been proposed. In an LPR-SC, experts can express multiple self-confidence levels when providing their preferences. Consistency of preference relations is an important premise for reliable and reasonable decision making. This research mainly focuses on the additive consistency exploration of LPRs-SC. To do that, some operational laws for LPRs-SC are introduced. Subsequently, an additive consistency index which considers both the linguistic preference values and the self-confidence is defined to measure the consistency level of LPR-SC. For an inconsistent LPR-SC, an optimization model and an iterative algorithm are developed to repair its consistency. It is worth noting that the inconsistency repairing methods proposed in this paper consider the acceptable adjustment range of experts, thereby increase their willingness to adjust the preference values and let the experts participate in the consistency improving process.

Therefore, multilevel thresholding is an indispensable image processing technique in the field of image segmentation and is employed widely to separate those similar objects. However, with increasing thresholds, the existing image segmentation techniques might suffer from exponentially-grown computational cost and low accuracy due to local optima shortage. Therefore, in this paper, a new image segmentation algorithm based on the improved marine predators algorithm (MPA) is proposed. MPA is improved using a strategy to find a number of the worst solutions within the population then tries to search for other better ones for those solutions by moving them gradually towards the best solutions to avoid accelerating to local optima and randomly within the search space based on a certain probability. In addition, this number of the worst solutions is increased with the iteration. This strategy is known as the linearly increased worst solutions improvement strategy (LIS). Also, we suggested that apply the ranking strategy based on a novel updating scheme, namely ranking-based updating strategy (RUS), on the solutions that could find better solutions in the last number iterations, perIter, in the hope of finding better solutions near it. RUS updates the particles/solutions which could not find better solutions than the best-local one in a number of consecutive iterations, with those that are generated based on a novel updating strategy. LIS is integrated with MPA to produce a new segmentation meta-heuristic algorithm abbreviated as MPALS. Also, MPALS and RUS are combined to tackle ISP in a strong variant abbreviated as HMPA for overcoming the image segmentation problem. The two proposed algorithms are validated on 14 test images and compared with seven state-of-the-arts meta-heuristic algorithms. The experimental results show the effectiveness of HMPA with increasing the threshold levels compared to the seven state-of-the-arts algorithms when segmenting an image, while their performance is roughly the same for the image with a small threshold level.",,,,,"Mohamed, Reda/AAD-7426-2022",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,APR,2022.0,55.0,4,,,,,3315.0,3367.0,,10.1007/s10462-021-10086-0,0.0,,OCT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000710911900001,0

Over these years, decomposition and integration models have been applied more and more to realize the goal of precise prediction, however, many of them tend to neglect the reconstruction of features or the residual series. Altogether, one of the biggest drawbacks of the decomposition and integration framework is the method applied requires manual parameter setting whether it is for decomposition or integration. Still, for the results, they are merely satisfied with the point prediction which brings high uncertainty. In this paper, an optimized feature reconstruction decomposition and two-step nonlinear integration method is proposed which gives consideration to feature reconstruction, nonlinear integration, optimization and interval prediction. The original data series is decomposed through improved variational mode decomposition based approximate entropy feature reconstruction system. Then, improved particle swarm optimization-gated recurrent unit (iPSO-GRU) is utilized in the first and second nonlinear integration part separately. Meanwhile, the residual series is given attention, if it is not a white noise series, the residual will be the input of iPSO-GRU whose result will be added back to the second integration result to form the point prediction result. Based on the point prediction result, interval prediction estimate will be generated as well via maximum likelihood function. This study chooses three kinds of digital currency as cases and the results show that the MAPE values of point prediction are all below 3.5%, and CP values of interval prediction are all 1 with suitable MWP.

In contrast, under the more realistic setting of dom/wdeg, the variable and value oriented methods cannot compete with standard propagation, while the node oriented method is very efficient.

Motivated by the power of PULTS and the linguistic scale function, this study aims to propose robust techniques to solve multi-attribute group decision making problems with uncertain linguistic evaluations. To enrich calculation and enhance the flexibility of PULTS, we first generalize the aggregation formula to fuse opinions of decision makers represented as PULTSs and secondly derive adjusting rule of probability to adjust the probability distribution of two or more than two probabilistic uncertain elements (PULEs) into the same probability distribution. Novel operations of PULTSs are designed based on the adjusting rule of probability distribution and linguistic scale function for the semantics of linguistic terms. Many related properties of these operations are also discussed. New score function and deviation degree of PULEs are also developed to compare PULEs. Two aggregation operators i.e., probabilistic uncertain linguistic averaging (PULWA) operator and probabilistic uncertain linguistic geometric (PULWG) operator are also redefined in terms of novel operations. In addition, a series of distance measure is defined to overcome the shortcomings of existing ones. After defining a correlation measure, the probabilistic uncertain linguistic (PUL)-consensus reaching method (in which two specific consensus approaches are described separately) is put forward to refine the consensus level of a group. To suit the needs of different semantics, two robust decision making methods named as consensus-based PUL-gained and lost dominance score method and consensus-based PUL-aggregation method are proposed.

It is then followed by the discussion on their use in various aspects of AM such as design for 3D printing, material tuning, process optimization, in situ monitoring, cloud service, and cybersecurity. Potential applications in the biomedical, tissue engineering and building and construction will be highlighted. The challenges faced by ML in AM such as computational cost, standards for qualification and data acquisition techniques will also be discussed. In the authors' perspective, in situ monitoring of AM processes will significantly benefit from the object detection ability of ML. As a large data set is crucial for ML, data sharing of AM would enable faster adoption of ML in AM. Standards for the shared data are needed to facilitate easy sharing of data.

The SCE divides a population into several parallel subsets called complex and then improves each sub-complex through an evolutionary process using a Nelder-Mead (NM) simplex search method. This algorithm applies its evolutionary process only on the worst member of each sub-complex whereas the role of other members is not operative. Therefore, the number and variety of search moves are limited in the evolutionary process of SCE. The current study focuses to overcome this drawback by proposing a corporate SCE (CSCE). This algorithm provides an evolutionary possibility for all members of a sub-complex. In the CSCE, each member is influenced by a simplex made from all other members of the current sub-complex. The CSCE barrows three actions of NM, i.e. reflection, contraction and expansion, and applied them on each member to find a better candidate than the current one. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is first tested on six benchmark problems. After achieving satisfactory performance on the test problems, it is applied to parameter identification problems and the obtained results are compared with some other algorithms reported in the literature.

To overcome such disadvantages, numerous seizure detection techniques involving signal processing and machine learning tools have been developed. However, there still remain the problems of automatic detection with high efficiency and accuracy in distinguishing normal, interictal and ictal electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. In this study we propose a novel method for automatic identification of epileptic seizures in singe-channel EEG signals based upon time-scale decomposition (ITD), discrete wavelet transform (DWT), phase space reconstruction (PSR) and neural networks. First, EEG signals are decomposed into a series of proper rotation components (PRCs) and a baseline signal by using the ITD method. The first two PRCs of the EEG signals are extracted, which contain most of the EEG signals' energy and are considered to be the predominant PRCs. Second, four levels DWT is employed to decompose the predominant PRCs into different frequency bands, in which third-order Daubechies (db3) wavelet function is selected for analysis. Third, phase space of the PRCs is reconstructed based on db3, in which the properties associated with the nonlinear EEG system dynamics are preserved. Three-dimensional (3D) PSR together with Euclidean distance (ED) has been utilized to derive features, which demonstrate significant difference in EEG system dynamics between normal, interictal and ictal EEG signals. Fourth, neural networks are then used to model, identify and classify EEG system dynamics between normal (healthy), interictal and ictal EEG signals. Finally, experiments are carried out on the University of Bonn's widely used and publicly available epilepsy dataset to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method. By using the 10-fold cross-validation style, the achieved average classification accuracy for eleven cases is reported to be 98.15%. Compared with many state-of-the-art methods, the results demonstrate superior performance and the proposed method can serve as a potential candidate for the automatic detection of seizure EEG signals in the clinical application.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,APR,2020.0,53.0,4,,,,,3059.0,3088.0,,10.1007/s10462-019-09755-y,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000524414900022,0

This paper presents a comparative study of various classifiers and the results achieved for offline handwritten Gurmukhi characters and numerals recognition. Various classifiers used and evaluated in this study include k-nearest neighbors, linear-support vector machine (SVM), RBF-SVM, Naive Bayes, decision tree, convolution neural network and random forest classifier. For the experimental work, authors used a balanced data set of 13,000 samples that includes 7000 characters and 6000 numerals. To assess the performance of classifiers, authors have used the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis which is an open source tool for machine learning. The performance is assessed by considering various parameters such as accuracy rate, size of the dataset, time taken to train the model, false acceptance rate, false rejection rate and area under receiver operating characteristic Curve. The paper also highlights the comparison of correctness of tests obtained by applying the selected classifiers. Based on the experimental results, it is clear that classifiers considered in this study have complementary rewards and they should be implemented in a hybrid manner to achieve higher accuracy rates.

The two proposed algorithms use the exponential moving average approach along with the Q-learning algorithm as a basis to update the policy for the learning agent so that the agent's policy converges to a Nash equilibrium policy. The first proposed algorithm uses a constant learning rate when updating the policy of the learning agent, while the second proposed algorithm uses two different decaying learning rates. These two decaying learning rates are updated based on either the Win-or-Learn-Fast (WoLF) mechanism or the Win-or-Learn-Slow (WoLS) mechanism. The WoLS mechanism is introduced in this article to make the algorithm learn fast when it is winning and learn slowly when it is losing. The second proposed algorithm uses the rewards received by the learning agent to decide which mechanism (WoLF mechanism or WoLS mechanism) to use for the game being learned. The proposed algorithms have been theoretically analyzed and a mathematical proof of convergence to pure Nash equilibrium is provided for each algorithm. In the case of games with mixed Nash equilibrium, our mathematical analysis shows that the second proposed algorithm converges to an equilibrium. Although our mathematical analysis does not explicitly show that the second proposed algorithm converges to a Nash equilibrium, our simulation results indicate that the second proposed algorithm does converge to Nash equilibrium. The proposed algorithms are examined on a variety of matrix and stochastic games. Simulation results show that the second proposed algorithm converges in a wider variety of situations than state-of-the-art multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms.",,,,,"Schwartz, Howard/AAT-4225-2021","Schwartz, Howard/0000-0002-4489-5892",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,MAR,2016.0,45.0,3,,,,,299.0,332.0,,10.1007/s10462-015-9447-5,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000377827400002,0

Inspired by the success of supervised bagging and boosting algorithms, we propose non-adaptive and adaptive resampling schemes for the integration of multiple independent and dependent clusterings. We investigate the effectiveness of bagging techniques, comparing the efficacy of sampling with and without replacement, in conjunction with several consensus algorithms. In our adaptive approach, individual partitions in the ensemble are sequentially generated by clustering specially selected subsamples of the given dataset. The sampling probability for each data point dynamically depends on the consistency of its previous assignments in the ensemble. New subsamples are then drawn to increasingly focus on the problematic regions of the input feature space. A measure of data point clustering consistency is therefore defined to guide this adaptation. Experimental results show improved stability and accuracy for clustering structures obtained via bootstrapping, subsampling, and adaptive techniques. A meaningful consensus partition for an entire set of data points emerges from multiple clusterings of bootstraps and subsamples. Subsamples of small size can reduce computational cost and measurement complexity for many unsupervised data mining tasks with distributed sources of data. This empirical study also compares the performance of adaptive and non-adaptive clustering ensembles using different consensus functions on a number of datasets. By focusing attention on the data points with the least consistent clustering assignments, whether one can better approximate the inter-cluster boundaries or can at least create diversity in boundaries and this results in improving clustering accuracy and convergence speed as a function of the number of partitions in the ensemble.

The objectives of our data mining project are: (1) to generalize from the limited set of counter examples and then apply this knowledge to large data bases of amino acid sequence in order to estimate commonness of disordered protein regions in nature, and (2) to determine whether there are different types of protein disorder. For general disorder estimation, a neural network based predictor was designed and tested on data built from several public domain data banks through a nontrivial search, statistical analysis and data dimensionality reduction. In addition, predictors for identification of family-specific disorder were developed by extracting knowledge from databases generated through multiple sequence alignments of a known disordered sequence to other highly related proteins. Family-specific predictors were also integrated to test quality of general protein disorder identification from such hybrid prediction systems. Out-of-sample cross validation performance of several predictors was computed first, followed by tests on an unrelated database of proteins with long disordered regions, and the application of few selected predictors to two large protein data banks: Nrl_3D, currently containing more than 10,000 protein fragments of known 3D structure, and Swiss Protein, having almost 60,000 protein sequences. The obtained results provide evidence that long disordered regions are common in nature, with an estimate that 11% of all the residues in the Swiss Protein data bank belong to disordered regions of length 40 or greater. The hypothesis that different protein disorder types exist is supported by high specificity/low sensitivity results of two family-specific predictors, by hybrid systems outperforming general models on a two-family test, and by existence of significant gaps in Swiss Protein vs. Nr1_3D disorder frequency estimates for both families. These findings prompt the need for a revision in the current understanding of protein structure and function, as well as for the developing of improved disorder predictors that should have important uses in biotechnology applications.",,,,,"Romero, Pedro R/D-4110-2018","Romero, Pedro R/0000-0002-6995-5193; Obradovic, Zoran/0000-0002-2051-0142",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,DEC,2000.0,14.0,6,,,,,447.0,484.0,,10.1023/A:1006678623815,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000167828000002,0

They need to be able to volunteer information, correct user misconceptions, and reject unethical requests when appropriate. In order to do these things, a system must be designed as an intelligent agent. That is, a system needs to have its own goals and then plan for these goals. A system which did not have its own goals would never refuse to help users perform unethical actions. Such an intelligent agent has been implemented in the UCEgo component of UC (Wilensky et al. 1984; Wilensky et al. 1988) (UNIX Consultant), a natural language system that helps the user solve problems in using the UNIX operating system. UCEgo provides UC with its own goals and plans. By adopting different goals in different situations, UCEgo creates and executes different plans, enabling it to interact appropriately with the user. UCEgo adopts goals when it notices that the user either lacks necessary knowledge, or has incorrect beliefs. In these cases, UCEgo plans to volunteer information or correct the user's misconception as appropriate. These plans are pre-stored skeletal plans that are indexed under the types of situations in which they are typically useful. Plan suggestion situations include the goal which the plan is used to achieve, the preconditions of the plan, and appropriateness conditions for the plan. Indexing plans by situations improves efficiency and allows UC to respond appropriately to the user in real time. Detecting situations in which a plan should be suggested or a goal adopted is implemented using if-detected daemons. These daemons provide a single mechanism which can be used both for detecting goals and suggesting plans.

Extensions of these algorithms, such as Time-Windowed forgetting (TWF), can permit learning of time-varying mappings by deleting older exemplars, but have decreased classification accuracy when the input-space sampling distribution of the learning set is time-varying. Additionally, TWF suffers from lower asymptotic classification accuracy than equivalent non-forgetting algorithms when the input sampling distributions are stationary. Other shift-sensitive algorithms, such as Locally-Weighted forgetting (LWF), avoid the negative effects of time-varying sampling distributions, but still have lower asymptotic classification in non-varying cases. We introduce Prediction Error Context Switching (PEGS), which allows lazy-learning algorithms to have good classification accuracy in conditions having a time-varying function mapping and input sampling distributions, while still maintaining their asymptotic classification accuracy in static tasks. PECS works by selecting and re-activating previously stored instances based on their most recent consistency record. The classification accuracy and active learning set sizes for the above algorithms are compared in a set of learning tasks that illustrate the differing time varying conditions described above. The results show that the PEGS algorithm has the best overall classification accuracy over these differing time-varying conditions, while still having asymptotic classification accuracy competitive with unmodified lazy-learners intended for static environments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,,,,,FEB,1997.0,11.0,1-5,,,,,133.0,155.0,,10.1023/A:1006515405170,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1997XE77700005,0

(The IDF Diabetes Atlas, Tenth Edition (haps://diabetesatlas.org/) Last visit: 7.14.2022)). Hence, timely detection of diabetes is very vital to prevent or delay the complications. Many researchers have believed that to deal with the vagueness in knowledge and complexity of diabetes, fuzzy set needs to be incorporated into diabetes prediction models to provide more realistic results. In a fuzzy environment, ranking of fuzzy numbers is a crucial prerequisite to make a decision. In this paper, a new phenomenon in ranking fuzzy numbers that we call setback is introduced. In setback which indicates the most confusing state in fuzzy ranking, the ranking order of fuzzy numbers is completely reversed when a new ranking method is applied to the same problem. Also a fuzzy risk analysis problem in diabetes prediction is studied in which person with the highest risk of diabetes is replaced with the lowest one and vice versa. With this result in hand, we reveal that defective ranking results in a medical problem have the potential to lead to disastrous effects on human health. We expose some potential causes of setback and to alleviate this problem two evaluation criteria and a benchmark are suggested. These criteria help researchers avoid severe pitfalls when introducing their own ranking methods. To achieve this goal, we first address serious drawbacks of some fuzzy ranking methods which have been recently published by reputed journals. Although the aim of this paper is not to challenge the theoretical advances in ranking methods, this paper shows that this field requires deeper studies to be proper to apply in actual cases, particularly medical decision-making. Hence, if the users do not pay attention to various aspects of ranking methods, they may fall into the trap of paradoxical results. This paper is expected to be useful for the medical researchers working in this field and for the scholars thinking about realization of fuzzy sets and ranking fuzzy numbers for real world applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s10462-022-10282-6,0.0,,OCT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000864970300001,0

So, to control this pollution as well as carbon emission, everyone should be aware to use eco-friendly products and reduce carbon emission. Motivating on this topic, a model on green manufacturing system has been formulated where the produced items are eco-friendly and have a fixed lifetime. Also, in this model, the green level of the produced items enhances the demand of the customers. The objective of this work is to determine the green level of the product and business period by maximizing the average profit of the system. To solve the corresponding maximization problems, a hybrid tournament differential evolution (TDE) algorithm is applied to obtain the best-found solutions along with the average profit of the system. To check the validity of the proposed model, a numerical example is considered and solved by the different variants of the said algorithm. Also, the simulated results obtained from the different variants of TDE algorithm are compared with the simulated results obtained from some of the existing algorithms reported in the literature. Then to test the performance and efficiency of the said hybrid algorithm, statistical comparisons, statistical tests are performed.

There are two parameters involved of the 3WDs with DTRSs such as conditional probability and loss functions. Here we mainly focus on the calculation of loss function using LSGDM approach. LSGDM problem is characterized by a large number of experts, multiple clusters and a mass of evaluation data given by the experts. In some cases, experts are unwilling to revise their opinions to reach a consensus. So, the proper management of experts opinions and their non-cooperative behaviors (NCBs) is necessary to establish a consensus model. An appropriate adjustment of the credibility information is also essential. Using the clustering method, the proposed model divides the experts with similar evaluations into a subgroup. In each cluster, the experts' opinions are then aggregate. In order to measure the level of consensus among clusters, the cluster consensus index (CCI) and group consensus index (GCI) have been developed. Then, using a tool for managing the NCBs of clusters includes two components: (1) for identifying the NCBs of clusters, NCB degree has defined using CCI and GCI; (2) for consensus improvement, implemented the weight punishment mechanism to NCBs clusters.

The indices and indicators were assigned weight and raked using Analytical Hierarchy Process and PROMETHEE methods respectively. Owing to existed ambiguity in some of the extracted indices, fuzzy sets theory was applied to model existed uncertainty in the problem. Finally, the proposed model was used for evaluating the e-services websites of 10 Iranian metropolitan municipalities. Final results showed that Qom and Kermanshah cities received the highest and lowest readiness of e-services websites respectively.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,DEC,2021.0,54.0,8,,,,,5699.0,5733.0,,10.1007/s10462-021-09956-4,0.0,,FEB 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000613578800001,0

Muhammad Atif",,,CHIRPS: Explaining random forest classification,ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW,,,,,,,,,,,,"Modern machine learning methods typically produce black box models that are opaque to interpretation. Yet, their demand has been increasing in the Human-in-the-Loop processes, that is, those processes that require a human agent to verify, approve or reason about the automated decisions before they can be applied. To facilitate this interpretation, we propose Collection of High Importance Random Path Snippets (CHIRPS); a novel algorithm for explaining random forest classification per data instance. CHIRPS extracts a decision path from each tree in the forest that contributes to the majority classification, and then uses frequent pattern mining to identify the most commonly occurring split conditions. Then a simple, conjunctive form rule is constructed where the antecedent terms are derived from the attributes that had the most influence on the classification. This rule is returned alongside estimates of the rule's precision and coverage on the training data along with counter-factual details. An experimental study involving nine data sets shows that classification rules returned by CHIRPS have a precision at least as high as the state of the art when evaluated on unseen data (0.91-0.99) and offer a much greater coverage (0.04-0.54). Furthermore, CHIRPS uniquely controls against under- and over-fitting solutions by maximising novel objective functions that are better suited to the local (per instance) explanation setting.",,,,,,"Gaber, Mohamed/0000-0003-0339-4474",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,DEC,2020.0,53.0,8,,,,,5747.0,5788.0,,10.1007/s10462-020-09833-6,0.0,,JUN 2020,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000538195700001,0

Spam emails not only waste users' time, but also consume a lot of network bandwidth, and may also include malware as executable files. Alternatively, phishing emails falsely claim users' personal information to facilitate identity theft and are comparatively more dangerous. Thus, there is an intrinsic need for the development of more robust and dependable UBE filters that facilitate automatic detection of such emails. There are several countermeasures to spam and phishing, including blacklisting and content-based filtering. However, in addition to content-based features, behavior-based features are well-suited in the detection of UBEs. Machine learning models are being extensively used by leading internet service providers like Yahoo, Gmail, and Outlook, to filter and classify UBEs successfully. There are far too many options to consider, owing to the need to facilitate UBE detection and the recent advances in this domain. In this paper, we aim at elucidating on the way of extracting email content and behavior-based features, what features are appropriate in the detection of UBEs, and the selection of the most discriminating feature set. Furthermore, to accurately handle the menace of UBEs, we facilitate an exhaustive comparative study using several state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.

In this series, the HM presented prediction results superior to both a support vector machine (SVM) and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) models. The experiments show that the proposed model is superior to HM, reducing the forecasting error of the HM by 32%. This means that the proposed model is also superior to the SVM and MLP models. An analysis of the construction and use of clusters associated with a series volatility study shows that data obtained from only one type of volatility (low or high) are enough to provide sufficient knowledge to the model so that it is able to forecast future values with good accuracy.

Despite the great evolution of time series modeling, forecasters are still in the hunt for better strategies to improve mathematical models and come up with more accurate predictions. In this respect, several new models, mixing autoregressive processes to artificial neural networks (ANNs), have recently emerged. This is particularly the case for energy economics, where old forecasting tools are replaced by new hybrid strategies. Along the same lines, this paper aims to define a wavelet-based hybridization, involving nonlinear smooth functions, autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA) model and feedforward ANNs, for electricity spot prices forecasting. The use of the wavelet decomposition in this model allows to characterize certain patterns of power time series, such as the nonlinear trend and multiple seasonal effects, and to exactly extrapolate them over the time scale. In fact, such patterns have already been pointed out as potential causes of the ANN's inaccuracy. An ARFIMA-ANN model is then used to forecast the resulting irregular component. In the last stage, the smooth and irregular components are recombined to constitute the forecasted price. We will demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of the proposed method using hourly power prices from the Nord Pool Exchange.

In image processing, there are various image analysis techniques that use the autocorrelation of an image in a broad range of applications from texture analysis to grain density estimation. This paper provides an extensive review of two recently introduced and related frameworks for image representation based on autocorrelation, namely Patch Autocorrelation Features (PAF) and Translation and Rotation Invariant Patch Autocorrelation Features (TRIPAF). The PAF approach stores a set of features obtained by comparing pairs of patches from an image. More precisely, each feature is the euclidean distance between a particular pair of patches. The proposed approach is successfully evaluated in a series of handwritten digit recognition experiments on the popular MNIST data set. However, the PAF approach has limited applications, because it is not invariant to affine transformations. More recently, the PAF approach was extended to become invariant to image transformations, including (but not limited to) translation and rotation changes. In the TRIPAF framework, several features are extracted from each image patch. Based on these features, a vector of similarity values is computed between each pair of patches. Then, the similarity vectors are clustered together such that the spatial offset between the patches of each pair is roughly the same. Finally, the mean and the standard deviation of each similarity value are computed for each group of similarity vectors. These statistics are concatenated to obtain the TRIPAF feature vector. The TRIPAF vector essentially records information about the repeating patterns within an image at various spatial offsets. After presenting the two approaches, several optical character recognition and texture classification experiments are conducted to evaluate the two approaches. Results are reported on the MNIST (98.93%), the Brodatz (96.51%), and the UIUCTex (98.31%) data sets.

As a result, extracting useful knowledge from such noisy data is a challenging task, that converts large-scale short-text learning tasks in social environments into one of the most relevant problems in machine learning and data mining. Feature selection is one of the most known and commonly used techniques for reducing the impact of the high dimensional feature space in text learning. A wide variety of feature selection techniques can be found in the literature applied to traditional, long-texts and document collections. However, short-texts coming from the social Web pose new challenges to this well-studied problem as texts' shortness offers a limited context to extract enough statistical evidence about words relations (e.g. correlation), and instances usually arrive in continuous streams (e.g. Twitter timeline), so that the number of features and instances is unknown, among other problems.

Thus, argumentation techniques have been applied for years in fields, such as rhetoric or artificial intelligence. More specifically, the agents paradigm fits into the use of these types of techniques because agents shape a society in which they interact to make arrangements or to decide future actions. Those interactions can be modelled using argumentation techniques. Therefore, the application of those techniques in multi-agent systems is an interesting research field. However, no systematic review has been conducted previously, to the best of the authors' knowledge, to provide an overview of argumentation techniques for multi-agent systems. This paper presents a systematic review of argumentation techniques for multi-agent systems research. The period of time that is included in this review is from 1998 to 2014. The objective of this review is to obtain an overview of the existing approaches and to study their impact on research and practice. The research method has been defined to identify relevant studies based on a predefined search strategy, and it is clearly defined to facilitate the reading of this paper. All of the included studies in this review have been analysed from two different points of view: the Application view and the Multi-Agent System view. A comprehensive analysis of the extracted data is provided in the paper, which is based on a set of research questions that are defined. The results of this review reveal suggestions for further research and practice. The argumentation technology is actually in a phase of internal enhancement and exploration.

Hence, there has been growing interest in the development of new approaches and technologies for bridging the human-computer barrier. The ultimate aim is to bring HCI to a regime where interactions with computers will be as natural as an interaction between humans, and to this end, incorporating gestures in HCI is an important research area. Gestures have long been considered as an interaction technique that can potentially deliver more natural, creative and intuitive methods for communicating with our computers. This paper provides an analysis of comparative surveys done in this area. The use of hand gestures as a natural interface serves as a motivating force for research in gesture taxonomies, its representations and recognition techniques, software platforms and frameworks which is discussed briefly in this paper. It focuses on the three main phases of hand gesture recognition i.e. detection, tracking and recognition. Different application which employs hand gestures for efficient interaction has been discussed under core and advanced application domains. This paper also provides an analysis of existing literature related to gesture recognition systems for human computer interaction by categorizing it under different key parameters. It further discusses the advances that are needed to further improvise the present hand gesture recognition systems for future perspective that can be widely used for efficient human computer interaction.

In this respect, the study in the domain of knowledge learning is of paramount importance in terms of capturing and reuse of tacit and explicit knowledge. To support the process of knowledge learning, a methodology to establish an intelligent system, which consists of both On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) and fuzzy logic principles, is suggested. This paper attempts to propose this approach for integrating OLAP and fuzzy logic to form an intelligent system, capitalizing on the merits and at the same time offsetting the drawbacks of the involved technologies.

J,"Borner, K",,,,"Borner, K",,,Efficient case-based structure generation for design support,ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW,,,,,,,,,,,,"This paper describes a general approach to support case-based structure generation named Conceptual Analogy (Borner 1997). The approach can be used to support design tasks in domains that do not allow the acquisition of a complete and consistent set of constraints or rules but that do provide a larger set of past experiences. The experiences - also called cases - may resemble for example CAD data of room layouts or pipe systems. Thus, cases represent solutions to particular problems without an explicit, a priori separation of problem and solution variables. The paper starts with a description and formalization of the case-based structure generation task and a discussion of why standard case-based reasoning and other approaches are not applicable. Then, the new approach of Conceptual Analogy (CA) is introduced. CA applies conceptual clustering to organize cases represented by graphs into hierarchical classes of structurally similar cases. These case classes are then represented by concepts. Given a problem, i.e., a partial solution, the hierarchy of concepts is searched for applicable concepts, i.e., concepts that allow the generation of at least one solution to the given problem. Applicable concepts are used to generate a set of solutions that can be ordered according to their quality. Properties of the approach as well as complexity results are presented. An architectural design domain and task where the approach has been applied successfully, is used for illustration and for practical evaluation. Finally, the approach and its implementation are compared to two systems that aim at the support of similar design tasks.

In fact, there are a host of applications of diagrams and diagrammatic representations in computing, from data presentation to visual programming languages. In contrast to both the use of diagrams in human problem solving and the ubiquitous use of diagrams in the computing industry, the topic of this review is the use of diagrammatic representations in automated problem solving.

Information about the user's knowledge also allows the system to take advantage of the user's prior knowledge in formulating explanations. The system can provide better answers by referring to the user's prior knowledge in the explanation (e.g., through use of similes). This process of refining answers is called answer expression. The process of answer expression has been implemented in the UCExpress component of UC (UNIX Consultant), a natural language system that helps the user solve problems in using the UNIX operating system. UCExpress separates answer expression into two phases: pruning and formatting. In the pruning phase, subconcepts of the answer are pruned by being marked as already known by the user (and hence do not need to be generated), or marked as candidates for generating anaphora or ellipsis (since they are part of the conversational context). In the formatting phase, UCExpress uses information about the user's prior domain knowledge to select among specialized expository formats, such as similes and examples, for expressing information to the user. These formats allow UCExpress to present different types of information to the user in a clear, concise manner.

We investigate two voting schemes: simple voting where voters have equal weight and weighted voting where weights depend on classifiers' confidences in their predictions. We consider ways to form such subsets for improved performance: When the training set is small, voting improves performance considerably. If the training set is not small, then voters converge to similar solutions and we do not gain anything by voting. To alleviate this, when the training set is of intermediate size, we use bootstrapping to generate smaller training sets over which we train the voters, When the training set is large, we partition it into smaller, mutually exclusive subsets and then train the voters. Simulation results on six datasets are reported with good results. We give a review of methods for combining multiple learners.

Also, Lasso sparse autoencoder is considered for feature nodes to achieve compact and sparse features.

This hybridization approach was proposed to reinforce the diversity ability of CSA and balance its search abilities for promising solutions to achieve robust search performance. The memory element of MHCSA was initialized with the best solution (pbest) of PSO to exploit the most promising search areas. The best positions of the CSA's individuals are improved using the best solution found so far (gbest) and (pbest) of PSO. Another flaw of CSA is the use of fixed flight length and awareness probability for crows to control exploration and exploitation features, respectively. This issue was circumvented here by replacing these constants with adaptive functions in order to provide a better balance between exploration and exploitation over the course of iterations. The competence of MHCSA was revealed by testing it on seventy-three standard and computationally complex benchmark functions. Its applicability was substantiated by solving seven engineering design problems.

HAR has been extensively studied using different paradigms, such as different reasoning mechanisms, including probabilistic, rule-based, statistical, logical reasoning, or the machine learning (ML) paradigm, to construct inference models to recognize or predict user activities. ML for HAR allows that activities can be recognized and even anticipated through the analysis of collected data from different sensors, with greater accuracy than the other paradigms. On the other hand, context-aware middlewares (CAMs) can efficiently integrate a large number of different devices and sensors. Moreover, they provide a programmable and auto-configurable infrastructure for streamline the design and construction of software solutions in scenarios where lots of sensors and data are their bases, such as ambient intelligence, smart cities, and e-health domains. In this way, the full integration of ML capabilities as services in CAMs can advance the development of software solutions in these domains when ML is necessary, specially for HAR, which is the basis for many scenarios in these domains.

The proposed HHO variant is termed as hybrid multi-leader HHO with differential evolution (MLHHDE). To help hawks overcome the situation of falling into local optimum during the searching process, an improved memory structure is introduced, which makes the hawks learn simultaneously from the historical best and global best positions. Besides, the multi-leader mechanism is also introduced to make full use of the valuable information from global best memories (leaders), enhance the diversity of hawks' search mode, and improve the hawks' exploration capability. Furthermore, differential evolution operations are integrated into HHO to further improve the weak exploration phase. Our proposed MLHHDE algorithm integrates a V-shaped transfer function, which can convert continuous solutions to binary solutions. To validate the modification of MLHHDE, we compared its performance with the advanced optimization algorithms through three experiments. In the first experiment, the performance of MLHHDE to solve a set of problems from the CEC 2017 benchmark is evaluated. Meanwhile, the second experiment aims to apply the binary version of MLHHDE to tackle the feature selection task by applying it to a set of sixteen datasets from the UCI repository. In the third, we applied the proposed model as a quantitative structure-activity relationship method to predict the influenza viruses H1N1 as a real-world application.

Weight initialization is a significant step employed before training any neural network. The weights of a network are initialized and then adjusted repeatedly while training the network. This is done till the loss converges to a minimum value and an ideal weight matrix is obtained. Thus weight initialization directly drives the convergence of a network. Therefore, the selection of an appropriate weight initialization scheme becomes necessary for end-to-end training. An appropriate technique initializes the weights such that the training of the network is accelerated and the performance is improved. This paper discusses various advances in weight initialization for neural networks. The weight initialization techniques in the literature adopted for feed-forward neural network, convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network and long short term memory network have been discussed in this paper. These techniques are classified as (1) initialization techniques without pre-training, which are further classified into random initialization and data-driven initialization, (2) initialization techniques with pre-training. The different weight initialization and weight optimization techniques which select optimal weights for non-iterative training mechanism have also been discussed. We provide a close overview of different initialization schemes in these categories.

It is observed that the Graphical Keyword Extraction Techniques (GKET) use Graph of Words (GoW) in literature for analysis in different dimensions. In this article, efforts have been made to study these different dimensions for GKET, namely, the GoW representation, the statistical properties of GoW, the stability of the structure of GoW, the diversity in approaches over GoW for GKET, and the ranking of nodes in GoW. To elucidate these different dimensions, a comprehensive survey of GKET is carried in different domains to make some inferences out of the existing literature. These inferences are used to lay down possible research directions for interdisciplinary studies of network science and NLP. In addition, the experimental results are analysed to compare and contrast the existing GKET over 21 different dataset, to analyse the Word Co-occurrence Networks (WCN) for 15 different languages, and to study the structure of WCN for different genres.

However, the existence of potential failures and defects not only influence the manufacturing process but also damages the resources and cause negative impacts on environment. Failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) is a key approach to identify and eliminate possible failures and evaluate the risks from design, system and process. This research paper provides a novel FMEA approach for risk evaluation by integrating rough set theory and ELimination and Choice Translating REality (ELECTRE) II method to handle the subjectivity and uncertainty in experts' judgements without much prior information, membership functions and additional adjustments. Rough numbers are used to study uncertainty in linguistic terms using intervals instead of single fixed values. The proposed approach is formulated by defining different types of concordance and discordance sets using optimization techniques based on statistical dispersion and maximum deviation method. The presented technique shows the strong, weak and neutral pairwise relations among failure modes by systemically comparing them from each risk component. The distance functions and averaging methods are applied to check the similarities and differences among error modes which improves the accuracy of the results. The developed rough FMEA approach is applied to identify the potential failures of robot working in optical cable industry and evaluate the risk components of manufacturing and production process.

Optimal scheduling of appliances is done for ten different scenarios that consider different demand response programs.

All this is done with a view of discussing the application of GANs in cybersecurity studies. Here, the paper reviews notable cybersecurity studies where the GAN plays a key role in the design of a security system or adversarial system. In general, from the review, one can observe two major approaches these cybersecurity studies follow. In the first approach, the GAN is used to improve generalization to unforeseen adversarial attacks, by generating novel samples that resembles adversarial data which can then serve as training data for other machine learning models. In the second approach, the GAN is trained on data that contains authorized features with the goal of generating realistic adversarial data that can thus fool a security system. These two approaches currently guide the scope of modern cybersecurity studies with generative adversarial networks.",,,,,,"Ugot, Ogban-Asuquo/0000-0001-8575-0609",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,MAR,2020.0,53.0,3,,,,,1721.0,1736.0,,10.1007/s10462-019-09717-4,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000519571700006,0

When considering the 5G industry evaluation, the basic issues involve strong uncertainty. Pythagorean fuzzy sets, depicted by membership degree and non-membership degree, are a more resultful means for capturing uncertainty. In this paper, the comparison issue in Pythagorean fuzzy environment is disposed by proposing novel score function. Next, the circle minus and circle divide operations are defined and their properties are proved. Later, the objective weight is calculated by Criteria Importance Through Inter-criteria Correlation method. Meanwhile, the combined weight is determined by reflecting both subjective weight and the objective weight. Then, the Pythagorean fuzzy decision making algorithm based Combined Compromise Solution is developed. Lastly, the validity of algorithm is expounded by the 5G evaluation issue, along with their sensitivity analysis.

However, cluster dependability has been ignored in the majority of the presented clustering ensemble methods that exposes them to the risk of the low-quality base clustering methods (and consequently the low-quality base clusters). In spite of some attempts made to evaluate the clustering methods, it seems that they consider each base clustering individually regardless of the diversity. In this study, a new clustering ensemble approach has been proposed using a weighting strategy. The paper has presented a method for performing consensus clustering by exploiting the cluster uncertainty concept. Indeed, each cluster has a contribution weight computed based on its undependability. All of the predicted cluster tags available in the ensemble are used to evaluate a cluster undependability based on an information theoretic measure. The paper has proposed two measures based on cluster undependability or uncertainty to estimate the cluster dependability or certainty. The multiple clusters are reconciled through the cluster uncertainty. A clustering ensemble paradigm has been proposed through the proposed method. The paper has proposed two approaches to achieve this goal: a cluster-wise weighted evidence accumulation and a cluster-wise weighted graph partitioning. The former approach is based on hierarchical agglomerative clustering and co-association matrices, while the latter is based on bi-partite graph formulating and partitioning. In the first step of the former, the cluster-wise weighing co-association matrix is proposed for representing a clustering ensemble. The proposed approaches have been then evaluated on 19 real-life datasets. The experimental evaluation has revealed that the proposed methods have better performances than the competing methods; i.e. through the extensive experiments on the real-world datasets, it has been concluded that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art. The substantial experiments on some benchmark data sets indicate that the proposed methods can effectively capture the implicit relationship among the objects with higher clustering accuracy, stability, and robustness compared to a large number of the state-of-the-art techniques, supported by statistical analysis.",,,,,"Nejatian, Samad/AAE-5912-2022; Nejatian, Samad/AAO-2981-2021; Rezaie, Seyedeh Vahideh/AAO-2996-2021","Parvin, Hamid/0000-0001-8717-7711",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,AUG,2019.0,52.0,2,,,,,1341.0,1368.0,,10.1007/s10462-019-09701-y,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000472573300018,0

Spectrum decision is one of the most important stages, but its optimal operation depends on the characterization sub-stage, which is in charge of efficiently estimating time gaps in which a PU won't make use of the assigned spectrum, so that it can be used in an opportunistic fashion by SUs. The design and implementation of an algorithm based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network is proposed in order to increase the success percentage in the forecasting (presence/absence) of PUs in spectrum channels.

ME is established based on the divide-and-conquer principle in which the problem space is divided between a few neural network experts, supervised by a gating network. In earlier works on ME, different strategies were developed to divide the problem space between the experts. To survey and analyse these methods more clearly, we present a categorisation of the ME literature based on this difference. Various ME implementations were classified into two groups, according to the partitioning strategies used and both how and when the gating network is involved in the partitioning and combining procedures. In the first group, The conventional ME and the extensions of this method stochastically partition the problem space into a number of subspaces using a special employed error function, and experts become specialised in each subspace. In the second group, the problem space is explicitly partitioned by the clustering method before the experts' training process starts, and each expert is then assigned to one of these sub-spaces. Based on the implicit problem space partitioning using a tacit competitive process between the experts, we call the first group the mixture of implicitly localised experts (MILE), and the second group is called mixture of explicitly localised experts (MELE), as it uses pre-specified clusters. The properties of both groups are investigated in comparison with each other. Investigation of MILE versus MELE, discussing the advantages and disadvantages of each group, showed that the two approaches have complementary features.

GASAT (Lardeux et al. 2005, 2006; Hao et al. 2002) is one of the current state-of-the-art genetic algorithms for solving SATs. Besides, the discrete lagrange-multiplier (DLM) (Wu and Wah 1999a, b) is one of the current state-of-the-art local search algorithms for solving SATs. GASAT is a hybrid algorithm of the genetic and tabu search techniques. GASAT uses tabu search to avoid restarting the search once it converges. In this paper, we improve GASAT by replacing the tabu search by the DLM algorithm. We show that the performance of the new algorithm, DGASAT, is far better than the performance of GASAT in solving most of the benchmark instances. We further improve DGASAT by introducing the notion of improving one of the best members in the current population at a time.

A small disjunct is a rule covering a small number of examples. Small disjuncts are a serious problem for effective classification, because the small number of examples satisfying these rules makes their prediction unreliable and error-prone. This paper offers two main contributions to the research on small disjuncts. First, it investigates six candidate solutions (algorithms) for the problem of small disjuncts. Second, it reports the results of a meta-learning experiment, which produced meta-rules predicting which algorithm will tend to perform best for a given data set. The algorithms investigated in this paper belong to different machine learning paradigms and their hybrid combinations, as follows: two versions of a decision-tree (DT) induction algorithm; two versions of a hybrid DT/genetic algorithm (GA) method; one GA; one hybrid DT/instance-based learning (IBL) algorithm. Experiments with 22 data sets evaluated both the predictive accuracy and the simplicity of the discovered rule sets, with the following conclusions. If one wants to maximize predictive accuracy only, then the hybrid DT/IBL seems to be the best choice. On the other hand, if one wants to maximize both predictive accuracy and rule set simplicity - which is important in the context of data mining - then a hybrid DT/GA seems to be the best choice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,SEP,2005.0,24.0,1,,,,,61.0,98.0,,10.1007/s10462-005-1586-7,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000228254900003,0

In contrast to A* however, which represents each node as a complete state, LTA* represents each node using an operator. This representation of the nodes makes LTA* dramatically efficient with respect to memory usage. Another advantage of LTA* is that it eliminates any need for computational effort to maintain a priority queue, and this elimination significantly increases speed. To test the effectiveness and efficiency of the method we have applied it to NP-hard problems in scheduling.

A set of membership functions at the input layer is partially linked with a layer of rules, using pre-set parameters. By means of a simplified centroid of gravity defuzzification method, the output becomes linear in the weights. Therefore, very fast estimation of the weight parameters can be achieved by using the orthogonal least squares (OLS) method, which also provides a method to efficiently remove the redundant fuzzy rules from the prototype rule base of the NUFZY system. In this paper, the NUFZY system is applied to identify lettuce growth and greenhouse temperature from real experimental data. Results show that the NUFZY model with the fast OLS training can perform quite well in predicting both lettuce growth and greenhouse temperature. In contrast to the mechanistic modeling procedures, the neuro-fuzzy approach offers an easier route and a fast way to build the nonlinear mapping of inputs and outputs. In addition, the resulting internal network structure of the NUFZY system is a self-explanatory representation of fuzzy rules. Under this frame, it is a perspective that one is able to incorporate the human knowledge in this approach, and, hopefully, to deduce any interpretable rules that describe the systems' behavior.",,,,,,"van Straten, Gerrit/0000-0001-8619-7040",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,FEB,1998.0,12.0,1-3,,,,,71.0,93.0,,10.1023/A:1006592422202,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000074581300005,0

Instructions may build on the current perception of the assembly environment on the one hand, and on the other on the knowledge-based understanding of grouped structures in the developing construct. To this end, a dynamic conceptualization must integrate information not only describing the types of the objects involved, but also their changing functional roles when becoming part of structured assemblies. We have developed an operational knowledge representation formalism, COAR (''Concepts for Objects, Assemblies, and Roles''), by which processes of dynamic conceptualization in sequences of assembly steps can be formally reconstructed. Inferences concern the assertion or retraction of aggregate representations in a dynamic knowledge base, as well as the computation of role changes for individual objects associated herewith.

There is now a move towards integrated systems in Artificial Intelligence (AI) (see Dennett 1991; Me Kevitt 1994a, 1994b) and that will cause a need for dire actions on lexical research in the form of integrated lexicons. We believe that lexicons must move towards a situation where natural language words are also defined in terms of spatial and visual structures. These spatial and visual structures will solve what have been two of the most prominent problems in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for years: (1) Where are symbolic semantic primitive meanings in computer programs grounded? and (2) how come some words, typically in the defining vocabulary, in dictionaries have circular definitions so that words end up defining each other?

Therefore, many other tasks are left to the operator, e.g. evaluating buildings' performance, detecting abnormal energy consumption, identifying the changes needed to improve efficiency, ensuring the security and privacy of end-users, etc. To that end, there has been a movement for developing artificial intelligence (AI) big data analytic tools as they offer various new and tailor-made solutions that are incredibly appropriate for practical buildings' management. Typically, they can help the operator in (i) analyzing the tons of connected equipment data; and; (ii) making intelligent, efficient, and on-time decisions to improve the buildings' performance. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic survey on using AI-big data analytics in BAMSs. It covers various AI-based tasks, e.g. load forecasting, water management, indoor environmental quality monitoring, occupancy detection, etc. The first part of this paper adopts a well-designed taxonomy to overview existing frameworks. A comprehensive review is conducted about different aspects, including the learning process, building environment, computing platforms, and application scenario. Moving on, a critical discussion is performed to identify current challenges. The second part aims at providing the reader with insights into the real-world application of AI-big data analytics. Thus, three case studies that demonstrate the use of AI-big data analytics in BAMSs are presented, focusing on energy anomaly detection in residential and office buildings and energy and performance optimization in sports facilities.

To suppress the effect of perturbations, we try to employ the integral feedback control to design a new algorithm. Firstly, the control system model of the traditional algorithm, i.e., the Newton algorithm is presented. Hence, the correlation between the control system and algorithm has been established. Then, the integral control feedback is added to the system to construct the proportional-integral iterative (PII) algorithm. The PII algorithm is thus endowed with robustness against various perturbations that are proved in theory. Moreover, numerical simulations among the Newton algorithms, the zeroing neural network, and the proposed PII algorithm are performed for comparison, which verify the theoretical analyses and demonstrate the superior robustness of the PII algorithm.

The prediction criteria are first predefined to characterize and convert the learning data in an online engineering course. An evolutionary computation technique is then used to explore the best prediction model for the student academic performance. The model is validated using another online course that applies the same pedagogy and technology. Satisfactory agreements are obtained between the course outputs and model prediction results. The main findings indicate that the dominant variables in academic performance are the knowledge acquisition, the participation in class and the summative performance. The prerequisite knowledge tends not to play a key role in academic performance. Based on the results, pedagogical and analytical implications are provided.

However, the non-availability of adequate labeled data for training limits the performance of these algorithms. Data augmentation is an appropriate solution to this problem. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can successfully generate synthetic speech and sounds of musical instruments for classification applications. In this paper, we present a method for GAN-based augmentation in the context of environmental sound classification. We introduce an architecture named EnvGAN for the adversarial generation of environmental sounds. To validate the quality of the generated sounds, we have conducted subjective and objective evaluations. The results indicate that EnvGAN can produce samples of various domains with an acceptable target quality. We applied this augmentation technique on three benchmark ESC datasets (ESC-10, UrbanSound8K, and TUT Urban Acoustic Scenes development dataset) and used it for training a CNN-based classifier. Experimental results show that this new augmentation method can outperform a baseline method with no augmentation by a relatively wide margin (10-12% on ESC-10, 5-7% on UrbanSound8K, and 4-5% on TUT). In particular, the GAN-based approach reduces the confusion between all pairs of classes on UrbanSound8K.

However, there are many methods to estimate missing values, and no single method is the best for all datasets. In this article, we propose a data-driven missing value imputation approach that performs a feature-wise selection of the best imputation method, using known information in the dataset to rank the five methods we selected, based on their estimation error rates. We evaluated the proposed approach in two sets of experiments: a classifier-independent scenario, where we compared the applicabilities and error rates of each imputation method; and a classifier-dependent scenario, where we compared the predictive accuracy of Random Forest classifiers generated with datasets prepared using each imputation method and a baseline approach of doing no imputation (letting the classification algorithm handle the missing values internally). Based on our results from both sets of experiments, we concluded that the proposed data-driven missing value imputation approach generally resulted in models with more accurate estimations for missing data and better performing classifiers, in longitudinal datasets of human ageing. We also observed that imputation methods devised specifically for longitudinal data had very accurate estimations.

Over the last few years, in response to the climatic change, significant amount of research has been conducted worldwide to understand the quantitative link between soil temperature and the climatic factors, and it was highlighted that the hydrothermal conditions in the soil are continuously changing in response to the change of the hydro-meteorological factors. A large amount of the models have been developed and used in the past for the analysis and modelling of soil temperature, however, none of them has investigated the robustness and feasibilities of the deep echo state network (Deep ESN) model. A more accurate model for forecastingT(s)presents many worldwide opportunities in improving irrigation efficiency in arid climates and help attain sustainable water resources management. This research compares the application of the novel Deep ESN model versus three conventional machine learning models for soil temperature forecasting at 10 and 20 cm depths. We combined several critical daily hydro-meteorological data into six different input combinations for constructing the Deep ESN model. The accuracy of the developed soil temperature models is evaluated using three deterministic indices. The results of the evaluation indicate that the Deep ESN model outperformed conventional machine learning methods and can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) accuracy of the traditional models between 30 and 60% in both stations. In the test phase, the most accurate estimation was obtained by Deep ESN at depths of 10 cm by RMSE = 2.41 degrees C and 20 cm by RMSE = 1.28 degrees C in Champaign station and RMSE = 2.17 degrees C (10 cm) and RMSE = 1.52 degrees C (20 cm) in Springfield station.

We define the controversies nearby the diagnosis of MPD with its associated mental disorders. We discuss the various symptoms of MPD, dissociative amnesia, depersonalization or derealization disorder, and major depression disorder. After this exploration, we perceive that these disorders enclose parallel symptoms and it is difficult to identify the accurate type of disorder with its severeness. Since in experimental diagnosis the indeterminacy and falsity parts are often neglected. Due to this problem, we cannot see the accuracy in the patient's improvement record and cannot predict the duration of treatment. To eradicate these boundaries, we present the m-polar neutrosophic soft set (MPNSS) and m-polar neutrosophic soft mapping (MPNS-mapping) with its inverse mapping. These notions are proficient and valuable to diagnose the disorder appropriately by connecting it with the mathematical modeling. The connection of m-polar neutrosophic set (MPNS) with the soft set characterizes a relation among patients, symptoms, and treatments which decreases the complexity of the case study. We build a chart based on a fuzzy interval [0, 1] to range the types of disorders. We establish an algorithm based on MPNS-mapping to identify the disease appropriately and to select the finest treatment for the corresponding disease of every patient.

Prior work has explored the foot shape features using length, width, major axis, minor axis, centroid, etc. but they are not reliable for personal verification due to similarity in the physical composition of two persons. It increases the demand for more unique features based on the footprint. Footprint texture features coming from creases of foot palm are unique and permanent like palmprint texture features. Hence the main objective of the paper is to investigate various kinds of texture feature techniques. These techniques will be further used in correct extraction of footprint features. After extraction of footprint features a detailed experimental analysis is performed to discover the uniqueness in foot texture. It is further utilized to test its viability as a human recognition trait. We describe a detailed feature extraction and classification technique applied to a collected footprint data-set. For feature extraction, we use three techniques: Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Histogram Oriented Gradient (HOG), and Local Binary Patterns (LBP). Feature classification is performed using four techniques: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Ensemble Subspace Discriminant (ESD).GLCMprovides less accuracy, while HOG generates a big feature vector which takes more execution time. LBP provides a trade-off between the accuracy and the execution time.

Multigranulation rough set theory utilizes a voting principle to combine the decision options derived from individual granulated knowledge. Note that those knowledge may provide different degrees of support to the final results, some are key, some are of less importance and some are even of no use. Selecting valuable knowledge and reducing worthless one are thus necessary for data processing, which can alleviate the storage occupancy and facilitate the logical and statistical analysis. However, the basic reduction foundation of multigranulation spaces has been rarely touched by researchers, which brings in many difficulties in algorithmic and real applications. This work aims to disclose the principles of multiple knowledge reduction in multigranulation spaces from the viewpoint of discernibility. First, the notions of knowledge reduction of multigranulation spaces are defined based on multigranulation rough set theory. Second, a decision function mapping each object into the decision options of its neighborhood granule is introduced. Third, several pairs of discernibility matrices and discernibility functions are successively developed using the decision function. We claim that the valuable and worthless knowledge in multigranulation spaces can be explicitly chose and eliminated respectively by using the proposed discernibility matrices and discernibility functions. That is to say, these discernibility tools provide a precise criterion for the knowledge reduction of multigranulation spaces. As a theoretical extension, a multigranulation information entropy is proposed and an approximate algorithm is constructed to compute a suboptimal reduct of a multigranulation space based on this entropy. In the end, numerical experiments are performed on public data sets to verify the effectiveness of the proposed reduction methods.

In this paper, we aim to improve the intrinsic calculation of the IC by leveraging not only the hyponyms and hypernyms of concepts, but also the explicit evidences of synonymy and polysemy that ontologies such as WordNet also model.

As more enterprises move their activities on the Web, the volume and the diversity of the product-related information increase quickly. These factors make it difficult for the users to identify and compare the features of their desired products. Recent studies proved that the standard similarity metrics cannot effectively identify identical products, since similar titles often refer to different products and vice-versa. Other studies employ external data sources to enrich the titles; these solutions are rather impractical, since the process of fetching external data is inefficient. In this paper we introduce UPM, an unsupervised algorithm for matching products by their titles that is independent of any external sources. UPM consists of three stages. During the first stage, the algorithm analyzes the titles and extracts combinations of words out of them. These combinations are evaluated in stage 2 according to several criteria, and the most appropriate of them are selected to form the initial clusters. The third phase is a post-processing verification stage that refines the initial clusters by correcting the erroneous matches. This stage is designed to operate in combination with all clustering approaches, especially when the data possess properties that prevent the co-existence of two data points within the same cluster.

Although there exist many multi-criteria decision-making methods put forward for handling the HFLTSs, they were developed based on the assumption that the decision makers can always provide completely rational assessments and they do not take the decision makers' psychological behaviors into consideration. In this paper, the traditional TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese for interactive multi-criteria decision making) method is extended to handle the HFLTSs based on the novel comparison function and distance measure. Firstly, we put forward a novel function for comparing two HFLTSs more effectively. After that, a novel hesitance degree function as well as some novel distance measures are given for HFLTSs. Then we apply them to extend the traditional TODIM method for solving the HFLTSs.

Two issues are always concerned in a FR task: one is the dimensionality reduction (DR) of the features, and the other is the sparse representation for the samples. DR is an important step because it can not only reduce the storage space of face images, but also enhance the discrimination of the features. Meanwhile, sparse representation based classification (SRC) has been proved a powerful method to solve the problem of dimensionality. It simply considers the training samples as the dictionary to represent the testing samples. However, most of the SRC algorithms do not consider the structure of the dictionary. To consider these two aspects, in this paper, we proposed a FR method by combining a new DR model with the structured sparse representation (SSR). The key idea is projecting the images on a learned projection matrix, and performing the face classification by the SSR considering the structure information of the dictionary.

The diagnosis of faults using knowledge discovery techniques has become an essential component of the process, accounting to the challenges faced by the electrical power monitoring systems.

Sometimes, these systems are disrupted by events like a short circuit in the system or any external incursion that could pose a threat to the public safety as well as to the critical infrastructure of the grid. This paper aims at providing a robust system for fault diagnosis using the status of an intelligent electronic device and circuit breakers which can be tripped by any kind of fault. To protect the system from vulnerabilities and different kinds of faults, a multilayered fault estimation classifier, based on the Dominance based rough set is proposed.

There are many modeling methodologies to do the work of modeling semantic information instead of natural language processing. Since this field is very broad, the comparison discussed here is not an exhaustive study but rather the partial views of the coauthors from our own perspectives. In the present paper we give a review of the literature of conceptual models especially static one and then classify them into four type models namely structure-based model, object-oriented model, knowledge semantic-based model, and web semantic-based model. Based on the classification given above, a hierarchy structured criteria is given. According to the criteria we pick one or two representative conceptual models from each type to conduct the comparison. We compare the following five aspects of conceptual models: expressivity, clarity, semantics, formal foundation, and application fields. The comparative study shows that different models have different features and fit different fields of engineering applications. The present comparison study is useful for users to understand and choose right conceptual models combining with specific requirements of engineering applications.",,,,,,"Zeng, Yong/0000-0001-6678-271X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,FEB,2012.0,37.0,2,,,,,97.0,117.0,,10.1007/s10462-011-9221-2,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000300283700002,0

On low dimensional functions and for large values of tolerance the DSFL is slower than the SFL, but their success rates are equal. Part of this slowness could be attributed to the extra bits used for data coding.

The problem has been solved using numerous statistical, soft computing and other approaches. In this paper we solve the problem of robotic path planning using a combination of A* algorithm and Fuzzy Inference. The A* algorithm does the higher level planning by working on a lower detail map. The algorithm finds the shortest path at the same time generating the result in a finite time. The A* algorithm is used on a probability based map. The lower level planning is done by the Fuzzy Inference System (FIS). The FIS works on the detailed graph where the occurrence of obstacles is precisely known. The FIS generates smoother paths catering to the non-holonomic constraints. The results of A* algorithm serve as a guide for FIS planner. The FIS system was initially generated using heuristic rules. Once this model was ready, the fuzzy parameters were optimized using a Genetic Algorithm. Three sample problems were created and the quality of solutions generated by FIS was used as the fitness function of the GA. The GA tried to optimize the distance from the closest obstacle, total path length and the sharpest turn at any time in the journey of the robot. The resulting FIS was easily able to plan the path of the robot. We tested the algorithm on various complex and simple paths. All paths generated were optimal in terms of path length and smoothness.

This paper draws on recent work on probabilistic measures of coherence by investigating two measures with contrasting properties and then explores how this work relates to similarity of fuzzy sets and comparison of knowledge bases in cases where inconsistency is present. In each area contrasting measures are proposed analogous to the probabilistic case. In particular, concepts of fuzzy and logical independence are proposed and in each area it is found that sensitivity to the relevant concept of independence is a distinguishing feature between the contrasting measures. In the case of inconsistent knowledge bases, it is argued that it is important to take agreeing information and not just conflicting and total information into account when comparing two knowledge bases. One of the measures proposed achieves this and is shown to have a number of properties which enable it to overcome some problems encountered by other approaches.",,,,,,"Glass, David/0000-0002-6180-696X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,NOV,2006.0,26.0,3,,,,,227.0,249.0,,10.1007/s10462-007-9061-2,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000252222600004,0

Microarray data is noisy and typically composed of a low number of samples and a large number of genes. Perceptrons can constitute an efficient tool for accurate classification of microarray data. Nevertheless, the large input layers necessary for the direct application of perceptrons and the low samples available for the training process hamper its use. Two strategies can be taken for an optimal use of a perceptron with a favourable balance between samples for training and the size of the input layer: (a) reducing the dimensionality of the data set from thousands to no more than one hundred, highly informative average values, and using the weights of the perceptron for feature selection or (b) using a selection of only few genes that produce an optimal classification with the perceptron. In this case, feature selection is carried out first. Obviously, a combined approach is also possible. In this manuscript we explore and compare both alternatives. We study the informative contents of the data at different levels of compression with a very efficient clustering algorithm (Self Organizing Tree Algorithm). We show how a simple genetic algorithm selects a subset of gene expression values with 100% accuracy in the classification of samples with maximum efficiency.

The grading is achieved by simultaneously imaging each item of fruit from six orthogonal directions as it is propelled through an inspection chamber. In order to achieve the required throughput, the system contains state-of-the-art processing hardware, a novel mechanical design, and three separate algorithmic components. One of the key improvements in this system is a method for recognising the point of stem attachment (the calyx) so that it can be distinguished from defects. A neural network classifier on rotation invariant transformations (Zernike moments) is used to recognise the radial colour variation that is shown to be a reliable signature of the stem region.

Learning from experience can help to identify the particular situations for which the domain-independent heuristics need to be overridden. Most of the past learning approaches are fully deductive and eagerly acquire correct control knowledge from a necessarily complete domain theory and a few examples to focus their scope, These learning strategies are hard to generalize in the case of nonlinear planning, where it is difficult to capture correct explanations of the interactions among goals, multiple planning operator choices, and situational data.

Three-way conflict analysis research has achieved remarkable results and has been extended to Pythagorean fuzzy information systems because the three-way decision coincides with three attitudes of agents on issues, where the positive and negative degrees of agents are depicted by the membership and non-membership degrees. However, agent's opinions on issues must not be expressed only by real numbers, and the form of ranges can be used. Interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy sets allow the membership and non-membership degrees of a given set to have interval values, which can effectively handle this problem. This work analyzes a three-way conflict analysis based on interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy information systems. First, we introduce the concept of interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy information systems and illustrate how to divide positive, neutral, and negative alliances by the measurement function and thresholds. Then, we focus on a three-way conflict analysis based on prospect theory by considering the subjective risk attitude and preference of decision-makers. Finally, we further investigate three-way conflict analysis based on interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy sets and prospect theory with group decision theory, where the outcome matrices are provided by multiple experts. Several examples of software development project team conflicts are employed to illustrate the process of conducting a three-way conflict analysis based on interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy information systems and prospect theory. The comparative analysis is utilized to show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed three-way conflict analysis approach compared with other models and methods.",,,,,,"Wang, Tianxing/0000-0001-9146-1504; Zhang, Libo/0000-0001-5992-0790",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s10462-022-10327-w,0.0,,NOV 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000885842300001,0

From the time of the first detection of infection amongst the public, researchers investigated various applications in the fight against the COVID-19 outbreak and outlined the crucial roles of different research areas in this unprecedented battle. In the context of existing studies in the literature surrounding COVID-19, related to medical treatment decisions, the dimensions of context addressed in previous multidisciplinary studies reveal the lack of appropriate decision mechanisms during the COVID-19 outbreak. Multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) has been applied widely in our daily lives in various ways with numerous successful stories to help analyse complex decisions and provide an accurate decision process. The rise of MCDM in combating COVID-19 from a theoretical perspective view needs further investigation to meet the important characteristic points that match integrating MCDM and COVID-19. To this end, a comprehensive review and an analysis of these multidisciplinary fields, carried out by different MCDM theories concerning COVID19 in complex case studies, are provided. Research directions on exploring the potentials of MCDM and enhancing its capabilities and power through two directions (i.e. development and evaluation) in COVID-19 are thoroughly discussed. In addition, Bibliometrics has been analysed, visualization and interpretation based on the evaluation and development category using R-tool involves; annual scientific production, country scientific production, Wordcloud, factor analysis in bibliographic, and country collaboration map. Furthermore, 8 characteristic points that go through the analysis based on new tables of information are highlighted and discussed to cover several important facts and percentages associated with standardising the evaluation criteria, MCDM theory in ranking alternatives and weighting criteria, operators used with the MCDM methods, normalisation types for the data used, MCDM theory contexts, selected experts ways, validation scheme for effective MCDM theory and the challenges of MCDM theory used in COVID-19 studies. Accordingly, a recommended MCDM theory solution is presented through three distinct phases as a future direction in COVID19 studies. Key phases of this methodology include the Fuzzy Delphi method for unifying criteria and establishing importance level, Fuzzy weighted Zero Inconsistency for weighting to mitigate the shortcomings of the previous weighting techniques and the MCDM approach by the name Fuzzy Decision by Opinion Score method for prioritising alternatives and providing a unique ranking solution.

In order to protect confidential data, histogram-based reversible data hiding with other cryptographic algorithms are widely used. Therefore, in the proposed work, a robust method for securing digital video is suggested. We implemented histogram bit shifting based reversible data hiding by embedding the encrypted watermark in featured video frames. Histogram bit shifting is used for hiding highly secured watermarks so that security for the watermark symbol is also being achieved. The novelty of the work is that only based on the quality threshold a few unique frames are selected, which holds the encrypted watermark symbol. The optimal value for this threshold is obtained using the Firefly Algorithm. The proposed method is capable of hiding high-capacity data in the video signal.

The purpose of this work is to analyze a model with interval valued parameters for deteriorating items considering two situations (with shortages and without shortage) in the discount environment. Moreover, deterioration rate is taken into account as interval valued and unit carrying cost is supposed to be a function of the length of storage time as well as interval valued purchase cost. Also, the interval valued purchase cost is assumed to be a step function (decreasing) of lot size under discount business policy. Considering without shortage and with shortages separately, using parametric approach of interval differential equations, the proposed model is formulated in two different cases.

This approach has been investigated in various fields, one of them being that of bioinformatics. One of the most frequent applications of ensemble techniques involves research into cardiovascular diseases, which are considered the leading cause of death worldwide. The purpose of this research work is to identify the papers that investigate ensemble classification techniques applied to cardiology diseases, and to analyse them according to nine aspects: their publication venues, the medical tasks tackled, the empirical and research types adopted, the types of ensembles proposed, the single techniques used to construct the ensembles, the validation frameworks adopted to evaluate the proposed ensembles, the tools used to build the ensembles, and the optimization methods employed for the single techniques. This paper reports the carrying out of a systematic mapping study. An extensive automatic search in four digital libraries: IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, PubMed, and Scopus, followed by a study selection process, resulted in the identification of 351 papers that were used to address our mapping questions. This study found that the papers selected had been published in a large number of different resources. The medical task addressed most frequently by the selected studies was diagnosis. In addition, the experiment-based empirical type and evaluation-based research type were the most dominant approaches adopted by the selected studies. Homogeneous ensembles were the ensemble type that was developed most often in literature, while decision trees, artificial neural networks and Bayesian classifiers were the single techniques used most frequently to develop ensemble classification methods. The weighted majority and majority voting rules were adopted to obtain the final decision of the ensembles developed. With regard to evaluation frameworks, the datasets obtained from the UCI and PhysioBank repositories were those used most often to evaluate the ensemble methods, while the k-fold cross-validation method was the most frequently-employed validation technique. Several tools with which to build ensemble classifiers were identified, and the type of software adopted with the greatest frequency was open source. Finally, only a few researchers took into account the optimization of the parameter settings of either single or meta ensemble classifiers. This mapping study attempts to provide a greater insight into the application of ensemble classification methods in cardiovascular diseases. The majority of the selected papers reported positive feedback as regards the ability of ensemble methods to perform better than single methods.

Cognitive Architectures (CAs) differentiate from traditional AI approaches, due to their intention to model cognitive and behavioral processes by understanding the brain's structure and their functionalities in a natural way. However, the development of distinct CAs has not been easy, mainly because there is no consensus on the theoretical basis, assumptions or even purposes for their creation nor how well they reflect human function. In consequence, there is limited information about the methodological aspects to construct this type of models. To address this issue, some initial statements are established to contextualize about the origins and directions of cognitive architectures and their development, which help to outline perspectives, approaches and objectives of this work, supported by a brief study of methodological strategies and historical aspects taken by some of the most relevant architectures to propose a methodology which covers general perspectives for the construction of CAs. This proposal is intended to be flexible, focused on use-case tasks, but also directed by theoretic paradigms or manifestos. A case study between cognitive functions is then detailed, using visual perception and working memory to exemplify the proposal's assumptions, postulates and binding tools, from their meta-architectural conceptions to validation.

Fingerprint designs are exclusive in each human and the chance of two individuals having identical fingerprints is an exceptional case about one in sixty-four thousand million also the fingerprint minutiae patterns of the undistinguishable twins are different, and the ridge pattern of each fingertip remain unchanged from birth to till death. Fingerprints can be divided into basic four categories i.e. Loop, whorl, arch, and composites, nevertheless, there are more than 100 interleaved ridge and valleys physiognomies, called Galton's details, in a single rolled fingerprint. Due to the immense potential of fingerprints as an effective method of identification, the present research paper tries to investigate the problem of blood group identification and analysis of diseases those arises with aging like hypertension, type 2-diabetes and arthritis from a fingerprint by analyzing their patterns correlation with blood group and age of an individual. The work has been driven by studies of anthropometry, biometric trademark, and pattern recognition proposing that it is possible to predict blood group using fingerprint map reading.

The BDA problems are rather difficult to solve due to their large-scale, high-dimensional, and dynamic properties, while the problems with small data are usually hard to handle due to insufficient data samples and incomplete information. Such difficulties lead to the search-based data analytics problem, where a data analysis task is modeled as a complex, dynamic, and computationally expensive optimization problem and then solved by using an iterative algorithm. In this paper, we intend to present an extensive and in-depth discussion on the utilizing of evolutionary computation (EC) based optimization methods [including evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and swarm intelligence (SI)] for solving search-based data analysis problems. Then, as an example for illustration, we provide a comprehensive review of the applications of state-of-the-art EC methods for different types of data mining problems in bioinformatics. Here, the detailed analysis and discussion are conducted on three types of data samples, which include sequences data, network data, and image data. Finally, we survey the challenges faced by EC methods and the trend for future directions.

Functional roles must be used, instead, to model those pervasive and dynamic situations corresponding to events, activities, circumstances etc. that are characterized by spatio-temporal references; see, e.g., John is now acting as a student. They denote the specific function with respect to the global meaning of an event/situation/activity... that is performed by the entities involved in this event/situation... and formalize the dynamic and relational aspects of the notion of role. A functional role of the subject/agent/actor/protagonist... type is used to associate John with the notion of student or customer (semantic roles) during a specific time interval. Formally, functional roles are expressed as primitive symbols like subject, object, source, beneficiary. Semantic and functional roles interact smoothly when they are used to deal with challenging knowledge representation problems like the so-called counting problem, or when we need to set-up powerful inference rules whose atoms can directly denote complex situations. In this paper, the differentiation between semantic and functional roles will be illustrated from an narrative knowledge representation language (NKRL) point of view. NKRL is a high-level conceptual tool used for the computer-usable representation and management of the inner meaning of syntactically complex and semantically rich multimedia information. But, as we will see, the importance of this distinction goes well beyond its usefulness in a specific NKRL context. In particular, the use of functional roles is of paramount importance for the set-up of those evolved n-ary forms of knowledge representation that allow us to get rid from the limitations in expressiveness proper to the standard (binary) solutions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,APR,2019.0,51.0,4,,,,,537.0,575.0,,10.1007/s10462-017-9571-5,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000464760000002,0

In this paper, we present evidence against one approach to noun-noun compounds, namely that of arranging the meanings of compounds into a small, finite taxonomy of general semantic relations. Using a typical relation taxonomy, we conducted an experiment examining how people classify compounds into the taxonomy's relation categories. We found that people often select not one but several relations for each compound; for example, people classify coffee stain as coffee MAKES stain, stain MADE OF coffee, coffee CAUSES stain and stain DERIVED FROM coffee. A natural metric for relational similarity follows from our experimental data; we found that using cluster analysis to group compounds' interpretations with respect to this metric produced groupings that were different from the original taxonomic categories, suggesting that there is more than one way to classify the meanings of compounds. We also found that compounds which had similar constituent concepts tended to be interpreted with similar relations, indicating that the intrinsic properties of a compound's constituent concepts help determine how that compound is interpreted.

There are many clustering algorithms that attempt to provide an approximation of the optimal solution. These clustering techniques can be broadly classified into two categories. The techniques from first category directly assign objects to clusters and then analyze the resulting clusters. The methods from second category adjust representations of clusters and then determine the object assignments. In terms of disciplines, these techniques can be classified as statistical, genetic algorithms based, and neural network based. This paper reports the results of experiments comparing five different approaches: hierarchical grouping, object-based genetic algorithms, cluster-based genetic algorithms, Kohonen neural networks, and K-means method. The comparisons consist of the time requirements and within-group errors. The theoretical analyses were tested for clustering of highway sections and supermarket customers. All the techniques were applied to clustering of highway sections. The hierarchical grouping and genetic algorithms approaches were computationally infeasible for clustering a larger set of supermarket customers.

In his paper, Multi-valued Logics: A Uniform Approach to Reasoning in Artificial Intelligence, Ginsberg has shown that through the use of bilattices, several reasoning techniques can be unified under a single framework. A bilattice is a structure that can be viewed as a class of truth values that can accommodate incomplete and inconsistent information and in certain cases default information. In bilattice theory, knowledge is ordered along two dimensions: truth/falsity and certainty/uncertainty. By defining the corresponding bilattices as truth spaces, Ginsberg has: shown that the same theorem prover can be used to simulate reasoning in first order logic, default logic, prioritized default logic and assumption truth maintenance system. Although this is a significant contribution, Ginsberg's paper was lengthy and involved. Tills paper summarizes some of the essential concepts and foundations of bilattice theory. Furthermore, it discusses the connections of bilattice theory and several other existing multi-valued logics such as the various three-valued logics and Belnap's four-valued logic. It is noted that the set of four truth values in Belnap's logic form a lattice structure that is isomorphic to the simplest bilattice. Subsequently, Fitting proposed a conflation operation that can be used to select subsets of truth values from this and other bilattices. This method of selecting sub-sets of truth values provides a means for identifying sub-logic in a bilattice.",,,,,,"Sim, Kwang Mong/0000-0001-8618-2957",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,,,,,MAY,2001.0,15.0,3,,,,,219.0,240.0,,10.1023/A:1011049617655,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000168847600004,0

A major problem in natural-language processing is to build theories and models of how individual utterances cling together into a coherent discourse. The problem is important because, to properly understand natural language, a computer should have some sense of what it means for a discourse to be coherent and rational. Theories, models and implementations of natural-language processing argue for a measure of coherence based on three themes: meaning, structure, and intention. Most approaches stress one theme over all the others. Their future lies in the integration of components of all approaches. A theory of intention analysis solves, in part, the problem of natural-language dialogue processing. A central principle of the theory is that coherence of natural-language dialogue can be modelled by analysing sequences of intention. The theory of intention analysis has been incorporated within a computational model, called Operating System CONsultant (OSCON), implemented in Quintus Prolog, which understands, and answers in English, English questions about computer operating systems.

Combining different forecasting methods to construct efficient hybrid models has been widely reported in the literature regarding this challenge. Various types of hybrid models have been developed and successfully employed to improve forecasting accuracy. The well-known hybrid models can be generally categorized into four classes: (1) preprocessing-based, (2) parameter optimization-based, (3) components combination-based, and (4) postprocessing-based hybrid models. Despite the significant successes of hybrid models, efforts to access more accurate results face continued growth. Hybridization of hybrid models is a novel idea proposed to obtain extreme accuracy in recent literature, in which two or more hybrid classes are combined instead of conjoining the conventional individual forecasting methods. Although, in many publications, the aforementioned classes of hybrid models have been reviewed and analyzed in a wide variety of forecasting fields; no study is conducted to review the hybridization of hybrid models. This paper's main contribution is to fill this gap and provide classification and comprehensive review of the current endeavors done in the hybridization of hybrid models in time series forecasting areas. Our searches indicate that more than 250 papers have been published in recent years utilizing hybridization of hybrid models. In this paper, these published papers have been classified regarding their different used combination strategies into four main categories, including (1) Hybridization with preprocessing-based hybrid models (HPH), (2) Hybridization with parameter optimization-based hybrid models (HOH), (3) Hybridization with components combination-based hybrid models (HCH) and, (4) Hybridization with postprocessing-based hybrid models (HSH).

AI models show good performance for definite tasks such as image classification and text generation. With the recent development of generative models (e.g., BigGAN, GPT-3), AI models also show impressive results for diverse generation tasks (e.g., photo-realistic image, paragraph generation). As the performance of each AI model improves, interest in comprehensive tasks, such as visual language navigation (VLN) which follows the language instruction with an egocentric view, is also growing. However, the model integration for VLN has a problem due to the model complexity, modal heterogeneity, and paired data shortage. This study provides a comprehensive survey on VLN with a systemic approach for reviewing recent trends. At first, we define a taxonomy for fundamental techniques which need to perform VLN. We analyze from four perspectives of VLN: representation learning, reinforcement learning, component, and evaluation. We investigate the pros and cons of each component and methodology that have been conducted recently.

Management of water quality is inextricably bound up with a reliable prediction of the Water Quality Index (WQI) for various purposes. In this way, an accurate estimation of WQI is one of the most challenging issues in the water quality studies of surface water resources. There is a board range of traditional methodologies for the WQI evaluation. Due to the intrinsic limitations of conventional models, Data-Driven Models (DDMs) have been frequently employed to assess the WQI for natural streams. In the present research, WQI values and their typical classifications were obtained by guidelines of the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF). Hence, four well-known DDMs such as Evolutionary Polynomial Regression (EPR), M5 Model Tree (MT), Gene-Expression Programming (GEP), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS) are employed to predict WQI in Karun River. In this way, 12 Water Quality Parameters (i.e., Dissolved Oxygen, Chemical Oxygen Demand, Biochemical Oxygen Demand, Electrical Conductivity, Nitrate, Nitrite, Phosphate, Turbidity, pH, Calcium, Magnesium, and Sodium) were accumulated from nine hydrometry stations and additionally missing values of water temperature were extracted from images analysis of Landsat-7 ETM+. Furthermore, the Gamma Test (GT), Forward Selection (FS), Polynomial Chaotic Expression (PCE), and Principle Component Analysis (PCA) were used to reduce the volume of DDMs-feeding-input variables. Results of DDMs demonstrated that FS-M5 MT had the best performance for the estimation of WQI classification. WQI values for Karun River were assessed in the reliability-based probabilistic framework to consider the effect of any uncertainty and randomness in the input parameters. To this end, the Monte-Carlo scenario sampling technique was conducted to evaluate the limit state function from the DDMs-based-WQI formulation. Based on the qualitative description of the WQI, it was observed that the WQI of Karun River is classified into Relatively Bad quality. Moreover, based on the reliability analysis, there is only a 19% chance exists for a specimen from Karun River to have a better quality index.",,,,,"Farhadi, Hadi/AAR-2473-2021; Homaei, Farshad/V-4681-2019; Najafzadeh, Mohammad/K-1192-2019","Homaei, Farshad/0000-0001-5163-9240; Najafzadeh, Mohammad/0000-0002-4100-9699; Farhadi, Hadi/0000-0001-9251-6300",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,AUG,2021.0,54.0,6,,,,,4619.0,4651,,10.1007/s10462-021-10007-1,0.0,,APR 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000643174900001,0

However, testing the vulnerabilities of a system under unexpected events such as invalid inputs is essential. Furthermore, the mentioned global search algorithms tend to make big jumps in the system's state-space that are not concentrated on particular test goals. In this paper, we extend the HGAPSO approach into a cost-aware Memetic Algorithm (MA) by making small local changes through a proposed local search operator to optimize coverage score and testing costs. Moreover, we test GTS specifications not only under normal events but also under unexpected situations. So, three coverage-based testing strategies are investigated, including normal testing, robustness testing, and a hybrid strategy. The effectiveness of the proposed test generation algorithm and the testing strategies are evaluated through a type of mutation analysis at the model-level.

In the last feature and classification layers, the marginal and conditional distribution matching terms between domains are obtained via maximum mean discrepancy measurement to solve the under adaptation problem. To avoid negative transfer, the hypergraph regularization term is introduced to explore the high-order relationships among data. The classification performance of the model can be improved by preserving the statistical property and geometric structure simultaneously. Experimental results of 16 cross-domain transfer tasks verify that DAHDA outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.",,,,,,"wang, xuesong/0000-0002-5327-1088",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,OCT,2019.0,52.0,3,,,,,2061.0,2079,,10.1007/s10462-017-9576-0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000486256400017,0

In the real world, several data sets may vary dynamically and many incremental reduction algorithms have been proposed to update reduct. Further improvement of the performance of the incremental reduction approach is an important task that can help to increase the efficiency of knowledge discovery in dynamic data systems. This paper researches incremental reduction algorithms via an acceleration strategy to compute new reduct based on conflict region. We firstly introduce the concepts and propositions of the conflict region and give a static reduction algorithm based on the conflict region. Consequently, incremental mechanisms based on the conflict region and an acceleration strategy for reduction are discussed. Then, two incremental reduction algorithms for updating new reduct when one single object and multi-objects are added to decision systems are developed. Finally, experiments on different data sets from UCI show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms in decision systems with the addition of objects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,APR,2019.0,51.0,4,,,,,507.0,536,,10.1007/s10462-017-9570-6,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000464760000001,0

Moreover, semi-supervised transfer discriminant analysis based on cross-domain mean constraint (STDA-CMC) is proposed.

A genetic algorithm is a strong rule based classification algorithm which is used only for mining static small data sets. If the genetic algorithm can be made scalable and adaptable by reducing its I/O intensity, it will become an efficient and effective tool for mining large data sets like data streams. In this paper a scalable and adaptable online genetic algorithm is proposed to mine classification rules for the data streams with concept drifts. Since the data streams are generated continuously in a rapid rate, the proposed method does not use a fixed static data set for fitness calculation. Instead, it extracts a small snapshot of the training example from the current part of data stream whenever data is required for the fitness calculation. The proposed method also builds rules for all the classes separately in a parallel independent iterative manner. This makes the proposed method scalable to the data streams and also adaptable to the concept drifts that occur in the data stream in a fast and more natural way without storing the whole stream or a part of the stream in a compressed form as done by the other rule based algorithms. The results of the proposed method are comparable with the other standard methods which are used for mining the data streams.",,,,,"Raju, Nedunchezhian/AAI-1415-2020","Raju, Nedunchezhian/0000-0001-8438-0175; P, Dr Vivekanandan/0000-0002-7868-855X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,OCT,2011.0,36.0,3,,,,,163.0,178,,10.1007/s10462-011-9209-y,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000294814000001,0

In recent years, argumentation models have been used in different areas such as knowledge representation, explanation, proof elaboration, commonsense reasoning, logic programming, legal reasoning, decision making, and negotiation. However, these models address quite specific needs and there is need for a conceptual framework that would organize and compare existing argumentation-based models and methods. Such a framework would be very useful especially for researchers and practitioners who want to select appropriate argumentation models or techniques to be incorporated in new software systems with argumentation capabilities.

The rural small businesses selected for this study were individual farms within the Australian dairy industry and the developed KBDSS was called DairyPro. The object was to determine the factors that could help with future KBDSS development and improve adoption rates. These factors were tested against DairyPro to determine their effectiveness. This analysis indicates that system developers need to have a good working knowledge of the target industry and to understand the types of decisions that are made by managers in order to develop systems that will be used. A review of the literature also suggests that adoption rates can be influenced by cultural, political, educational and age factors as well as individual characteristics of information technology itself. Small business managers needed more ownership in the process of KBDSS development. The author suggests that the factors affecting KBDSS adoption by dairy farmers can be equally applicable to other small, owner-operated rural businesses.

Rights improve coordination and facilitate social action in Multi-Agent domains. Rights allow the agents enough freedom, and at the same time constrain them (prohibiting specific actions). Besides, rights can be understood as the basic concept underneath open normative systems where the agents reason about the code they must abide by. Typically, in such systems this code is underspecified. On the other hand, the agents might not have complete knowledge about the rules governing their interaction.

However, it is worth exploring whether the modalities have anything serious in common, in particular in the light of claim that most non-technical language use is metaphorical. What consequences would that have for the underlying relationship of language and vision: is it possible that vision is largely metaphorical? The conclusion (see also, Wilks 1978b and Wilks and Okada (in press) is that visual processing can embody structural ambiguity (whether compositional or not), but not anything analogous to metaphor. Metaphor is essentially connected with the extension of sense and only symbols can have senses.

Ophthalmologists receive support from various RFIA programs to cope with the detection of visual impairments. In this article, active deep learning (ADL) using new multi-layer architecture for automatic recognition of DR stages is presented. In order to facilitate the detection of retinal lesions in the ADL system preprocessing, the image is segmented using the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm with a threshold value determined according to the results of the image histogram. Besides, a tag-efficient convolutional neural networks (CNN) architecture known as ADL-CNN has been developed to automatically extract segmented retinal features. This model has a two-stage process. In the first, images are selected to learn simple or complex retinal features using basic accuracy labels in the training examples. Second, useful masks are provided with key lesion features and segment areas of interest within the retinal image. Performance evaluation of the proposed ADL-CNN model is made by comparing the most advanced methods using the same dataset. The efficiency of the system is made by measuring statistical metrics such as classification accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), and F-measure. The ADL-CNN model applied to the EyePacs dataset containing 35,122 retinal images yielded 99.66% ACC, 93.76% SE, 96.71% SP, and 94.58% F-measure.

Nonetheless, CPUs outperform other solutions including GPUs in many cases for the inference workload of DNNs with the support of various techniques, such as the high-performance libraries being the basic building blocks for DNNs. Thus, CPUs have been a preferred choice for DNN inference applications, particularly in the low-latency demand scenarios. However, the DNN inference efficiency remains a critical issue, especially when low latency is required under conditions with limited hardware resources, such as embedded systems. At the same time, the hardware features have not been fully exploited for DNNs and there is much room for improvement.

Several visual trackers have been presented in the last two decades. They target different tracking objectives. Object tracking from a real-time video is a challenging problem. Therefore, a robust tracker is required to consider many aspects of videos such as camera motion, occlusion, illumination effect, clutter, and similar appearance. In this paper, we propose an efficient object tracking algorithm that adaptively represents the object appearance using CNN-based features. A sparse measurement matrix is proposed to extract the compressed features for the appearance model without sacrificing the performance. We compress sample images of the foreground object and the background by the sparse matrix. When re-detection is needed, the tracking algorithm conducts an SVM classifier on the extracted features with online update in the compressed domain. A search strategy is proposed to reduce the computational burden in the detection step.

Dissimilarity space derived from automatically learned features and the possibility of transiting from one space to another when performing the tasks of the classification process are good examples of promising research directions in this field.",,,,,"de Souza Britto Jr, Alceu/AAC-1155-2022","Bertolini, Diego/0000-0002-6196-4538; Costa, Yandre/0000-0002-0630-3171",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,APR,2020.0,53.0,4,,,,,2783.0,2808,,10.1007/s10462-019-09746-z,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000524414900013,0

Hunting by BES is divided into three stages. In the first stage (selecting space), an eagle selects the space with the most number of prey. In the second stage (searching in space), the eagle moves inside the selected space to search for prey. In the third stage (swooping), the eagle swings from the best position identified in the second stage and determines the best point to hunt. Swooping starts from the best point and all other movements are directed towards this point. BES is tested by adopting a three-part evaluation methodology that (1) describes the benchmarking of the optimisation problem to evaluate the algorithm performance, (2) compares the algorithm performance with that of other intelligent computation techniques and parameter settings and (3) evaluates the algorithm based on mean, standard deviation, best point and Wilcoxon signed-rank test statistic of the function values. Optimisation results and discussion confirm that the BES algorithm competes well with advanced meta-heuristic algorithms and conventional methods.",,,,,"A.Alsattar, H./S-1079-2017; Zaidan, A.

A typical BCI system uses different types of inputs; however, Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are most widely used due to their non-invasive EEG electrodes, portability, and cost efficiency. The signals generated by the brain while performing or imagining a motor related task [motor imagery (MI)] signals are one of the important inputs for BCI applications. EEG data is usually recorded from more than 100 locations across the brain, so efficient channel selection algorithms are of great importance to identify optimal channels related to a particular application. The main purpose of applying channel selection is to reduce computational complexity while analysing EEG signals, improve classification accuracy by reducing over-fitting, and decrease setup time. Different channel selection evaluation algorithms such as filtering, wrapper, and hybrid methods have been used for extracting optimal channel subsets by using predefined criteria. After extensively reviewing the literature in the field of EEG channel selection, we can conclude that channel selection algorithms provide a possibility to work with fewer channels without affecting the classification accuracy. In some cases, channel selection increases the system performance by removing the noisy channels. The research in the literature shows that the same performance can be achieved using a smaller channel set, with 10-30 channels in most cases. In this paper, we present a survey of recent development in filtering channel selection techniques along with their feature extraction and classification methods for MI-based EEG applications.",,,,,"Shum, Hubert P.

The performance of fuzzy Ontology decreases with the increase of fuzziness in the domain knowledge. Type-2 fuzzy Ontologies (T2FO) were introduced to represent the domain knowledge where the concepts are either extremely vague or their vagueness increases gradually. The type-2 fuzzy Ontology domain is continuously expanding and there is a need to provide a comprehensive review incorporating the literature of T2FO development approaches, its applications in different domains, reasoners developed for inferencing on type-2 fuzzy Ontology, and evaluation approaches. To perform a comprehensive survey about the T2FO, we used Google Scholar as the main literature research tool to review papers published between 1998 to 2018. We then summarized the published approaches by comparing their features proposed for T2FO development, reasoning or inference, and evaluation approaches.

Since the TWSVM has superiorities of the simple model, the high training speed and the good performance, it has drawn extensive attention. The initial TWSVM can only handle binary classification, however, the multi-class classification problems are also common in practice. How to extend TWSVM from binary classification to multi-class classification is an interesting issue. Many researchers have devoted to the study of multi-class TWSVM. Although the study of multi-class TWSVM has made great progress, there is little literature on the comparisons and summaries of different multi-class classifiers based on TWSVM, which not only makes it difficult for novices to understand the essential differences, but also leads to the problem that how to choose the suitable multi-class TWSVM for a practical multi-class classification problem. This paper aims to review the development of multi-class TWSVM in recent years. We group multi-classTWSVM reasonably and analyze them with the respect to the basic theories and geometric meaning. According to the structures of the multi-class TWSVM, we divide them to the following groups: one-versus-rest strategy based multi-classTWSVM, one-versus-one strategy based multi-class TWSVM, binary tree structure based multi-class TWSVM, one-versus-one-versus-rest strategy based multi-class TWSVM and all-versus-one strategy based multi-class TWSVM. Although the training processes of direct acyclic graph based multi-class TWSVM are much similar to that of one-versus-one multi-class TWSVM, the decision processes of direct acyclic graph based multi-class TWSVM have their own characteristics and disadvantages, so we divide them to a separate group.

Given a data set containing data whose classes are known, Machine Learning algorithms can be employed for the induction of a classifier able to predict the class of new data from the same domain, performing the desired discrimination. Some learning techniques are originally conceived for the solution of problems with only two classes, also named binary classification problems. However, many problems require the discrimination of examples into more than two categories or classes. This paper presents a survey on the main strategies for the generalization of binary classifiers to problems with more than two classes, known as multiclass classification problems.

The qualitative models are used to bridge the gap between the modeller's knowledge about the physiological phenomenon and the mathematical models. The qualitative models are represented by knowledge graphs, that are conceptual graphs containing only causal relations, aggregation relations, and generalisation relations between domain quantities. The relationships between the mathematical models and the qualitative models are explicitly represented in application frames. The automated modelling task consists of two subtasks. In the first subtask, Qualitative Process Analysis, a process structure graph is constructed using the qualitative models as building blocks. The process structure graph is a qualitative description of the phenomenon under study, that contains the processes that are responsible for the behaviour of the phenomenon.

In response to Searle's objections to the so-called ''robot reply'', the paper argues that such an integrated system could not be considered as essentially on a par with a purely inferential system of the traditional kind, unless one were prepared to regard even the human understanding system as ''purely syntactic'' (and therefore incapable of genuine understanding).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,,,,,APR,1996.0,10.0,1-2,,,,,21.0,35,,10.1007/BF00159213,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996UN21200004,0

The unrelated parallel machines scheduling problem (UPMSP), which is one of the various problem types that exist, found its application in many areas like manufacturing and distributed computing. Due to the complexity of the problem, heuristic and metaheuristic methods have dominantly been applied for solving it. Although this problem variant did not receive much attention as other models, recent years saw the increase of research dealing with the UPMSP. During that time, different problem variants, solution methods, and interesting research directions were considered. However, no study provided a systematic overview of the research in which heuristic methods are applied for solving the UPMSP.

We present a consolidated review of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) as an efficient neural coding scheme with the ability to model early visual and auditory neural processing. We created a self-contained, accessible Jupyter notebook using Python to demonstrate the efficient coding principle for different modalities following a consistent five-step strategy. For each modality, derived receptive field models from natural and non-natural inputs are contrasted, demonstrating how neural codes are not produced when the inputs sufficiently deviate from those animals were evolved to process. Additionally, the demonstration shows that ICA produces more neurally-appropriate receptive field models than those based on common compression strategies, such as Principal Component Analysis. The five-step strategy not only produces neural-like models but also promotes reuse of code to emphasize the input-agnostic nature where each modality can be modeled with only a change in inputs.

To address this limitation, we propose a modified BSA framework, called gQR-BSA, based on the quasi reflection-based initialization, quantum Gaussian mutations, adaptive parameter execution, and quasi-reflection-based jumping to change the coordinate structure of the BSA. In gQR-BSA, a quantum Gaussian mechanism was developed based on the best population information mechanism to boost the population distribution information. As population distribution data can represent characteristics of a function landscape, gQR-BSA has the ability to distinguish the methodology of the landscape in the quasi-reflection-based jumping. The updated automatically managed parameter control framework is also connected to the proposed algorithm. In every iteration, the quasi-reflection-based jumps aim to jump from local optima and are adaptively modified based on knowledge obtained from offspring to global optimum. Herein, the proposed gQR-BSA was utilized to solve three sets of well-known standards of functions, including unimodal, multimodal, and multimodal fixed dimensions, and to solve three well-known engineering optimization problems.

This forces companies to focus on advertisement quality. This work presents a content-based advertisement viewability prediction framework using Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods. The primary focus here is on the web-advertisements available on various online shopping websites. Most of the past work in this domain emphasizes on the scroll depth and dwell time of an ad. However, the features that directly influence the viewability of an ad have been overlooked in the past. Unlike other approaches, this work considers multiple in-ad features that directly influence its viewability. Some of these include color, urgency, language, offers, discount, type, and prominent gender. This work presents an AI-based framework for identifying the features attributing towards increased viewability of ads. Feature selection techniques are executed on the dataset to extract important attributes. Afterward, clustering is applied to confirm the number of class labels assigned to the instances. To validate the clustering results, three validation indices are used here, namely Davies Bouldin Index, Dunn Index, and Silhouette Coefficient. Five classifiers, i.e., Support Vector Machine, k- Nearest Neighbors, Artificial Neural Network, Random Forest, and Gradient Regression Boosting Trees are trained using multiple features and viewability of an ad is predicted. The obtained results confirm that various in-content ad features, i.e., gender, type, discount, layout, and crowdedness play a vital role in predicting an ad's viewability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,OCT,2021.0,54.0,7,,,,,5095.0,5125,,10.1007/s10462-021-10013-3,0.0,,MAY 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000648832900001,0

One of the recommender systems models is collaborative filtering (CF) which uses the ratings given by the users to the items. But many of these ratings may be noisy or inaccurate so they reduce the quality of the recommendations. Sometimes users, using fake profiles, try to change the recommendations in their favor. Since satisfaction and trust in such systems are very important and useful, it would be better to find a way to identify these types of users.

Most of the existing techniques employ a single user to validate mappings by annotating them using terms from a controlled set such as correct or incorrect. This single user based approach of validating mappings using a controlled set of vocabulary is restrictive. First, the use of controlled vocabulary does not maximize the user's effort since it restrains him/her from adding more meaning to the concepts participating in low-quality mappings using his/her own terms. Secondly, a single user approach of validating a wide range of mappings is error prone since even the most experienced user may not be familiar with all subtopics contained in the input ontologies.

Recognition of hand gestures is to find the re-occurrences of such spatio-temporal patterns through pattern matching. However, dynamic hand gestures have many obstacles for accurate recognition, including poor lighting conditions, camera's inability to capture dynamic gesture in focus, occlusion due to finger movement, color variations due to lighting conditions. The Microsoft Kinect device provides an effective way to solve the above issues and also provides the skeleton for more convenient hand localization and tracking. The aim of this study is to develop a new trajectory-based method for hand gesture recognition using Kinect. In the first step, trajectory-based hand gesture features including spatial position and direction of fingertips, are derived from Kinect. The properties associated with the hand motion dynamics are preserved in these features. In the second step, radial basis function (RBF) neural networks are employed to model and approximate the hand motion dynamics derived from different hand gestures which represent Arabic numbers (0-9) and English alphabets (A-Z). The trained patterns of the approximated hand motion dynamics is stored in constant RBF networks. In the last step, a bank of dynamical estimators is constructed for all the training patterns, in which the constant RBF networks are embedded in. By comparing the set of estimators with a test gesture pattern, a set of recognition errors are generated, in which the average L1 norms of the errors are taken as the recognition measure based on the smallest error principle. Finally, experiments are carried out to assess the performance of the proposed method compared with other state-of-the-art approaches. By using the twofold and tenfold cross-validation styles, the correct recognition rates for Arabic numbers (0-9) and English alphabets (A-Z) are reported to be 95.83%,97.25%, and 91.35%,92.63%, respectively.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,JUN,2019.0,52.0,1,,,,,563.0,583,,10.1007/s10462-019-09703-w,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000468576800021,0

This paper presents a creative multiagent and dynamic multi-deme architecture based on a novel collaboration mechanism for the solution of multiobjective real-parameter optimization problems. The proposed architecture comprises a number of multiobjective metaheuristic agents that act on subsets of a population based on a cyclic assignment order. The proposed multiagent architecture works iteratively in sessions including two consecutive phases: in the first phase, a population of solutions is divided into subpopulations based on dominance ranks of its elements. In the second phase, each multiobjective metaheuristic is assigned to work on a subpopulation based on a cyclic or round-robin order. Hence, each metaheuristic operates on a different-rank subpopulation in subsequent sessions, where a session starts with a new assignment of metaheuristics and ends when termination criteria for the session are satisfied. Individual agents have their local archives of non-dominated solutions extracted in a session, while there is a global archive keeping all non-dominated solutions found so far. At the end of each session, all subpopulations are combined into one global population to be used for the initialization of the next session. Similarly, all local archives are merged with the global archive to get the set of all non-dominated solutions found by all metaheuristics through working on subsets of different rank-levels. This way, the metaheuristics cooperate with each other by sharing their search experiences through collecting them in a common population and a common global archive.

In the traditional routing schemes, routing decisions of a wireless node may solely depend on a predefined set of routing policies, which may only be suitable for a certain network circumstances. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been shown to address this routing challenge by enabling wireless nodes to observe and gather information from their dynamic local operating environment, learn, and make efficient routing decisions on the fly. In this article, we focus on the application of the traditional, as well as the enhanced, RL models, to routing in wireless networks. The routing challenges associated with different types of distributed wireless networks, and the advantages brought about by the application of RL to routing are identified. In general, three types of RL models have been applied to routing schemes in order to improve network performance, namely Q-routing, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and partially observable Markov decision process. We provide an extensive review on new features in RL-based routing, and how various routing challenges and problems have been approached using RL. We also present a real hardware implementation of a RL-based routing scheme. Subsequently, we present performance enhancements achieved by the RL-based routing schemes. Finally, we discuss various open issues related to RL-based routing schemes in distributed wireless networks, which help to explore new research directions in this area.

TS helps users manage the vast amount of information available, by condensing documents' content and extracting the most relevant facts or topics included in them. The rapid development of emerging technologies poses new challenges to this research field, which still need to be solved. Therefore, it is essential to analyse its progress over the years, and provide an overview of the past, present and future directions, highlighting the main advances achieved and outlining remaining limitations. With this purpose, several important aspects are addressed within the scope of this survey. On the one hand, the paper aims at giving a general perspective on the state-ofthe- art, describing the main concepts, as well as different summarisation approaches, and relevant international forums. Furthermore, it is important to stress upon the fact that the birth of new requirements and scenarios has led to new types of summaries with specific purposes (e. g. sentiment-based summaries), and novel domains within which TS has proven to be also suitable for (e. g. blogs). In addition, TS is successfully combined with a number of intelligent systems based on HLT (e. g. information retrieval, question answering, and text classification). On the other hand, a deep study of the evaluation of summaries is also conducted in this paper, where the existing methodologies and systems are explained, as well as new research that has emerged concerning the automatic evaluation of summaries' quality. Finally, some thoughts about TS in general and its future will encourage the reader to think of novel approaches, applications and lines to conduct research in the next years.

The obtained results show that our discrete algorithms are faster than other algorithms. In general, when precision of answer and number of variables are low, the difference between our new algorithms and the other three algorithms is small in terms of speed, but by increasing precision of answer and number of variables, the needed number of function evaluations for other algorithms increases beyond manageable amounts, hence their success rates decrease.

Contrary to the belief regarding the superiority of constraint-based approaches, our empirical results show that a score-based approach performs better on our context dataset in terms of prediction power and learning time.

In three-way decision spaces, decision evaluation function satisfies minimum element axiom, monotonicity axiom and complement axiom. Since then, the research on construction method of decision evaluation functions from commonly used binary aggregation functions becomes a research hotspot. Meanwhile, uninorms, as one class of binary aggregation functions, have been successfully applied in various application problems, such as in decision making, image processing, data mining, etc. This paper continues to consider this research topic and mainly explores the new construction methods of decision evaluation functions based on uninorms. Firstly, we show two novel transformation methods from semi-decision evaluation functions to decision evaluation functions based on uninorms. Secondly, using known semi-decision evaluation functions, we give some new construction methods of semi-decision evaluation functions. Thirdly, we give some novel construction methods of decision evaluation functions and semi-decision evaluation functions related to fuzzy sets, interval-valued fuzzy sets, fuzzy relations and hesitant fuzzy sets. Based on them, decision maker can obtain more useful decision evaluation functions, thereby more choices can be used for realistic decision-making problems.

In some practical situations, each identity has only a single sample available for training. Face recognition under this situation is referred to as single sample face recognition and poses significant challenges to the effective training of deep models. Therefore, in recent years, researchers have attempted to unleash more potential of deep learning and improve the model recognition performance in the single sample situation. While several comprehensive surveys have been conducted on traditional single sample face recognition approaches, emerging deep learning based methods are rarely involved in these reviews. Accordingly, we focus on the deep learning-based methods in this paper, classifying them into virtual sample methods and generic learning methods.

There are three types of generic learning methods: combining traditional methods and deep features, improving the loss function, and improving network structure, all of which are covered in our analysis. Moreover, we review face datasets that have been commonly used for evaluating single sample face recognition models and go on to compare the results of different types of models. Additionally, we discuss problems with existing single sample face recognition methods, including identity information preservation in virtual sample methods, domain adaption in generic learning methods.

The calculation of irreducible testors is an expensive computational process; the complexity of the algorithms to calculate the complete set of irreducible testors exponentially depends on the number of characteristics that describe the objects in the problem. To improve the execution time of these algorithms, different alternatives have been developed, such as parallel implementations, hardware-software implementation, rearrangement of the data, as well as heuristics to generate just an irreducible testor or a subset of the entire set of irreducible testors, among other strategies.

Patients with unilateral ACL deficiency often demonstrate alterations of knee kinematics, kinetics and gait patterns in the deficient side in comparison to the unaffected contralateral side. This also leads to the early onset of osteoarthritis. In order to detect and monitor the progression of ACL deficiency over time, various classification approaches using spatiotemporal gait variables have been presented. In this study we propose a novel method for classifying gait patterns between ACL-deficient (ACLD) knee and unaffected contralateral ACL-intact (ACLI) knee based upon gait system dynamics, intrinsic time-scale decomposition (ITD) and neural networks. First, human leg is modeled as a double-pendulum to imitate and simplify the human walking. Since the lower extremities act as a kinetic chain during dynamic tasks, control of the hip joint will interact with knee motion. Related gait kinematic parameters including knee and hip joint angle and angular velocity are decomposed into a series of proper rotation components (PRCs) and a baseline signal by using the ITD method. The first PRCs of knee and hip joint angle and angular velocity are extracted, which contain most of the kinematic signals' vibration energy and are considered to be the predominant PRCs. Third, neural networks are then used as the classifier with feature vectors as the input to distinguish between ACLD and ACLI knees based on the difference of gait system dynamics between the two groups.

This paper presents five nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithms to find near-optimal Golomb ruler (OGR) sequences in a reasonable time. In order to improve the search space and further improve the convergence speed and optimization precision of the metaheuristic algorithms, the improved algorithms based on mutation strategy and Levy-flight search distribution are proposed. These two strategies help the metaheuristic algorithms to jump out of the local optimum, improve the global search ability so as to maintain the good population diversity. The OGRs found their potential application in channel-allocation method to suppress the four-wave mixing crosstalk in optical wavelength division multiplexing systems. The results conclude that the proposed algorithms are superior to the existing conventional computing algorithms i.e. extended quadratic congruence and search algorithm and nature-inspired optimization algorithms i.e. genetic algorithms, biogeography based optimization and simple big bang-big crunch to find near-OGRs in terms of ruler length, total optical channel bandwidth and computation time.

Building on a neurally plausible model of human visual perceptual organization, in which hyperstrings are formal counterparts of transient neural assemblies, I postulate that synchronization in such assemblies is a manifestation of transparallel information processing.

Firstly, we show that the concept of attribute interaction has a crucial role across different kinds of problem in data mining, such as attribute construction, coping with small disjuncts, induction of first-order logic rules, detection of Simpson's paradox, and finding several types of interesting rules. Hence, a better understanding of attribute interaction can lead to a better understanding of the relationship between these kinds of problems, which are usually studied separately from each other. Secondly, we draw attention to the fact that most rule induction algorithms are based on a greedy search which does not cope well with the problem of attribute interaction, and point out some alternative kinds of rule discovery methods which tend to cope better with this problem.

First, two novel transfer functions (SSr and VVr) based on the concept of opposition learning are proposed to transform the continuous search space into a binary search space and achieve a good balance between exploration and exploitation. Second, a ReliefF bootstrapping strategy is proposed to add and remove features directionally in the iterative process according to the feature weights.

A novel causal modelling technique, the Grey Causal Modelling (GCM) is proposed in this research that can model complex causal relationships in a system. The GCM technique, as illustrated in this study can consider four features in a complex causal modelling situation, which are characterised as; the events, the outcomes, the objectives, and the effects. The implementation of the proposed methodology involves a two-phase approach and the same needs evaluation data from experts in two stages. We also propose the idea of magnitude plots to quantify and represent the cause-consequence (event-outcome) relations in GCM. The application of GCM technique is demonstrated with two numerical examples in manufacturing environment. Also, a practical problem for achieving resilience and sustainability objectives in a case supply chain is solved. The methodology is implemented following a seven step procedure for the case, which briefly include; identification of key factors, obtain the influence ratings, separate the events and outcomes, rank the event-outcome pairs for each objectives, calculate the effects for situation sets, obtain the magnitude of effects and make the magnitude plots, and build the causal magnitude table and prioritise the causal factors. From the analysis of results of the case, it is seen that redundancy and adaptability emerge as the critical causal factors for the supply chain in consideration of resilience and sustainability objectives, together.

Since the commencement of the first set of classical metaheuristic algorithms namely genetic, particle swarm optimization, ant colony optimization, simulated annealing and tabu search in the early 70s to late 90s, several new advancements have been recorded with an exponential growth in the novel proposals of new generation metaheuristic algorithms. Because these algorithms are neither entirely judged based on their performance values nor according to the useful insight they may provide, but rather the attention is given to the novelty of the processes they purportedly models, these area of study will continue to periodically see the arrival of several new similar techniques in the future. However, there is an obvious reason to keep track of the progressions of these algorithms by collating their general algorithmic profiles in terms of design inspirational source, classification based on swarm or evolutionary search concept, existing variation from the original design, and application areas. In this paper, we present a relatively new taxonomic classification list of both classical and new generation sets of metaheuristic algorithms available in the literature, with the aim of providing an easily accessible collection of popular optimization tools for the global optimization research community who are at the forefront in utilizing these tools for solving complex and difficult real-world problems.

In this paper, an alternative method has been introduced for parallel processing on Graphic processing unit (GPU) with Compute unified device architecture (CUDA) in order to increase the speed of the system. The IRS has two main parallel processing criteria, which include the division of computations into hundreds of independent units and the time of calculation more than the time of transferring from the GPU. The IRS is divided into six stages including imaging, pre-processing, segmentation, normalization, feature extraction, and matching. In order to increase speed and accuracy, two stages of iris segmentation and matching play an important role in the IRS. In this paper parallel execution of an identical algorithm for these two stages has been used. The reason for paralleling the iris segmentation stage and their low speed matching is due to a great amount of information in the iris database, plenty of calculations and lack of data dependency in these two stages. For parallelism at the segmentation stage, for each radius, the Hough transform (HT) is a processor, and in the matching stage two parts are considered: The first part consists of 32 actions comparing the input code with the database code in parallel and in the second part 2048 bits with the use of threads on each processor is performed in two sub-sections in pairs of bits and in parallel with each other. Finally, the two-way coding is achieved. In compare of existing methods, this method has rather more accurate and is also superior in terms of processing time on the GPU with CUDA. The results of the implementation of the above method on the images in UBIRIS, BATH, CASIA and MMUI databases show that the proposed method has a precision accuracy of 99.12%, 97.98%, 98.80% and 98.34%, respectively, and the average speedup for parallel processing of images in the database in the proposed method on the GPU with CUDA are 18.8, 14.7, 18, and 19 times, respectively.",,,,,"Shahidinejad, Ali/V-5523-2019; Mahlouji, Mahmoud/AAN-6765-2021","Shahidinejad, Ali/0000-0003-4856-9119; Mahlouji, Mahmoud/0000-0001-8895-8501",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,JUN,2020.0,53.0,5,,,,,3705.0,3729,,10.1007/s10462-019-09776-7,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000534130800018,0

No free lunch theorem implies that each specific task needs its own tailored machine learning algorithm to be designed. A set of strategies and preferences are built into learning machines to tune them for the problem at hand. These strategies and preferences, with the core concern of generalization improvement, are collectively known as regularization. In deep learning, because of a considerable number of parameters, a great many forms of regularization methods are available to the deep learning community. Developing more effective regularization strategies has been the subject of significant research efforts in recent years. However, it is difficult for developers to choose the most suitable strategy for their problem at hand, because there is no comparative study regarding the performance of different strategies. In this paper, at the first step, the most effective regularization methods and their variants are presented and analyzed in a systematic approach.

To explore functions of different categories of microorganisms is a fundamental work in biological studies, which can assist biologists and related scientists to get to know more properties, habits and characteristics of these tiny but obbligato living beings. However, taxonomy of microorganisms (microorganism classification) is traditionally investigated through morphological, chemical or physical analysis, which is time and money consuming. In order to overcome this, since the 1970s innovative content-based microscopic image analysis (CBMIA) approaches are introduced to microbiological fields. CBMIA methods classify microorganisms into different categories using multiple artificial intelligence approaches, such as machine vision, pattern recognition and machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, because CBMIA approaches are semi- or full-automatic computer-based methods, they are very efficient and labour cost saving, supporting a technical feasibility for microorganism classification in our current big data age. In this article, we review the development history of microorganism classification using CBMIA approaches with two crossed pipelines.

By this pipeline, it is easy for microbiologists to have an insight into each special application domain and find their interested applied CBMIA techniques.

However, with the increased number of SI algorithms, most research focuses on the implementation of a specific choice of SI algorithms, and there has been rare research analyzing the common features among SI algorithms coherently. More importantly, no general principles for the implementation and improvement of SI algorithms exist for solving various optimization problems. In this research, aiming to cover such a research gap, a unified framework towards SI is proposed inspired by the in-depth analysis of SI algorithms. The unified framework consists of the most frequently used operations and strategies derived from typical examples of SI algorithms. Following the proposed unified framework, the intrinsic features of SI algorithms can be understood straightforwardly and the implementation and improvement of SI algorithms can be achieved effortlessly, which is of great importance in practice. The numerical experiments examine the effects of the possible strategies employed in the unified framework, and provide pilot attempts to validate the performance of different combinations of strategies, which can not only facilitate specific SI algorithm application, but also can motivate SI algorithm innovation.",,,,,"; YU, Kai Ming/A-1179-2014","Lau, HCW/0000-0001-8500-5684; YU, Kai Ming/0000-0002-5187-9006; Lee, Carman/0000-0001-8577-4547",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,FEB,2017.0,47.0,2,,,,,253.0,277,,10.1007/s10462-016-9481-y,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000394301400004,0

There are currently two major methods proposed for solving this task. The first proposed solution is a random-walk MCMC algorithm. Although it eventually gives the correct distribution, it can be very slow in multi-modal distributions. The second approach called the ellipsoid method is practically more efficient for problems in which users have good prior information, but a correctness is not guaranteed. In this paper, we present a framework which can unify these two approaches. The key idea is to merge both methods into a single Markov chain using a trick called Metropolis-coupled MCMC. Once merged, they can validly exchange information to each other. Although the chain constructed from the ellipsoid approach cannot be proven to be correct, it usually rapidly converges to a useful stationary distribution, and its information can help the other chain constructed by the random-walk approach to converge faster to the correct distribution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,JUN,2009.0,31.0,1-4,,,,,1.0,15,,10.1007/s10462-009-9121-x,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000272847500001,0

In such systems, when the cases contain both numeric and free-text attributes, similarity-based retrieval cannot exploit standard speedup techniques based on multi-dimensional indexing, and the retrieval is implemented by an exhaustive comparison of the case to be solved with the whole set of stored cases. In this work, we review current research on Peer-to-Peer (P2P) and distributed CBR techniques and propose a novel approach for storage of the case-base in a decentralized Peer-to-Peer environment using the notion of Unspecified Ontology to improve the performance of the case retrieval stage and build CBR systems that can scale up to large case-bases. We develop an algorithm for efficient retrieval of approximated most-similar cases, which exploits inherent characteristics of the unspecified ontology in order to improve the performance of the case retrieval stage in the CBR problem solving cycle. The experiments show that the algorithm successfully retrieves cases close to the most-similar cases, while reducing the number of cases to be compared.

In this approach, named Progressive RL, an agent acquires experience of operating in a simple environment through experimentation, and then engages in a period of introspection, during which it rationalises the experience gained and formulates symbolic knowledge describing how to behave in that simple environment. When subsequently experimenting in a more complex but related environment, it is guided by this knowledge until it gains direct experience. A test domain with 15 maze environments, arranged in order of difficulty, is described. A range of experiments in this domain are presented, that demonstrate the benefit of Progressive RL relative to a basic RL approach in which each puzzle is solved from scratch.

However, mere manipulation - either with 3-D input devices (e.g., the DataGlove(TM 1)) or with spoken language (Mochizuki and Kishino 1991) - does not do justice to this new paradigm, which could prove to be revolutionary for human-to-human and human-to-machine - communication. This paper discusses the possibility of providing the means for VR-based CSCW participants not only to interactively manipulate, but also to generate and modify 3-D shapes using verbal descriptions, along with simple hand gestures. To this end, the paper also proposes a framework for interactive indexing of knowledge-level descriptions (Newell 1982, Tijerino and Mizoguchi 1993) of human intentions to a symbol-level representation based on deformable superquadrics (Pentland 1986; Horikoshi and Kasahara 1990, Terzopoulos 1991).

The combination of deep neural networks with RL has gained increased traction in recent years and is slowly shifting the focus from single-agent to multiagent environments. Dealing with multiple agents is inherently more complex as (a) the future rewards depend on multiple players' joint actions and (b) the computational complexity increases. We present the most common multiagent problem representations and their main challenges, and identify five research areas that address one or more of these challenges: centralised training and decentralised execution, opponent modelling, communication, efficient coordination, and reward shaping. We find that many computational studies rely on unrealistic assumptions or are not generalisable to other settings; they struggle to overcome the curse of dimensionality or nonstationarity. Approaches from psychology and sociology capture promising relevant behaviours, such as communication and coordination, to help agents achieve better performance in multiagent settings.

Utilizing the proposed algorithm, a numerical investigation was conducted on 233 mathematical test functions with dimensions of 2-100, and 150,000 function evaluations were performed for optimization purposes. For comparison, a total of ten different classical and new metaheuristic algorithms were utilized as alternative approaches. The statistical measurements include the best, mean, median, and standard deviation of 100 independent optimization runs, while well-known statistical analyses, such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis, and Post-Hoc analysis, were also conducted. The obtained results prove that the FHO algorithm exhibits better performance than the compared algorithms from literature. In addition, two of the latest Competitions on Evolutionary Computation (CEC), such as CEC 2020 on bound constraint problems and CEC 2020 on real-world optimization problems including the well-known mechanical engineering design problems, were considered for performance evaluation of the FHO algorithm, which further demonstrated the superior capability of the optimizer over other metaheuristic algorithms in literature.

Sentiment analysis (SA) is the umbrella term for techniques and approaches that analyze user's sentiments, emotions, opinions in text or other media. The need for a better understanding of these opinions paved the way to novel approaches that focus on the analysis of the sentiment related to specific features of a product, giving birth to the field of aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). Although the increasing interest in this discipline, there is still confusion regarding the basic concepts of ABSA: terms like sentiment, affect, emotion, opinion, are used as synonyms while they represent different concepts. This often leads to an incorrect analysis of the users' opinions.This work presents an overview of the state-of-the-art techniques and approaches for ABSA, highlighting the main critical issues related to current trends in this field. Following this analysis, a new reference model for SA and ABSA, namely the KnowMIS-ABSA model, is proposed. The model is grounded on the consideration that sentiment, affect, emotion and opinion are very different concepts and that it is profoundly wrong to use the same metric and the same technique to measure them. Accordingly, we argue that different tools and metrics should be adopted to measure each of the dimensions of an opinion.

However, effective cardiac auscultation requires trained physicians whose work is tough, laborious and subjective. The objective of this study is to develop an automatic classification method for anomaly (normal vs. abnormal) detection of PCG recordings without any segmentation of heart sound signals. Hybrid signal processing and artificial intelligence tools, including tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT), variational mode decomposition (VMD), phase space reconstruction (PSR) and neural networks, are utilized to extract representative features in order to model, identify and detect abnormal patterns in the dynamics of PCG system caused by heart disease. First, heart sound signal is decomposed into a set of frequency subbands with a number of decomposition levels by using the TQWT method. Second, VMD is employed to decompose the subband of the heart sound signal into different intrinsic modes, in which the first four intrinsic modes contain the majority of the heart sound signal's energy and are considered to be the predominant intrinsic modes. They are selected to construct the reference variable for analysis. Third, phase space of the reference variable is reconstructed, in which the properties associated with the nonlinear PCG system dynamics are preserved. Three-dimensional PSR together with Euclidean distance has been utilized to derive features, which demonstrate significant difference in PCG system dynamics between normal and abnormal heart sound signals. Finally, PhysioNet/CinC Challenge heart sound database is used for evaluation and the synthetic minority over-sampling technique method is applied to balance the datasets. By using the 10-fold cross-validation style, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed features with dynamical neural networks based classifier yield classification performance with sensitivity, specificity, overall score and accuracy values of 97.73% 98.05%, 97.89%, and 97.89%, respectively.

Different metadata standards exist for describing various types of digital objects. Several researches have reported on how to address issues related to accessing of metadata resources. Most studies on metadata involve cultural heritage domain, and this is an indication of the importance of this domain in metadata research and development. Research on metadata in cultural heritage mainly revolves around three fundamental issues: (1) lack of quality in metadata contents in most of the cases, (2) difficulty in accessing metadata contents due largely to limited user's knowledge on the content of the metadata, and (3) heterogeneity of the data at the level of schemas which makes the access even more difficult. The lack of quality in metadata makes it difficult for the users to retrieve and explore information that satisfies their needs. So, in order to make its contents more accessible, enhancing the metadata content is required, especially for cultural heritage collections which consist of digital objects (structured documents) described by a variety of metadata schemas. This paper presents issues and challenges in enhancing access to metadata by reviewing the existing approaches in metadata environment with a particular emphasis on cultural heritage collections. In this paper, firstly, we look at the classification of metadata which is divided into two categories namely data retrieval and information retrieval. Then, we present the analysis, findings and suggestions on how to address issues in enhancing access to metadata contents especially in cultural heritage collections. A detailed comparison is given between information retrieval and data retrieval, and it focuses on the applicability of one approach over the other. A framework that aims to improve the effectiveness of retrieval when searching metadata is also proposed and tested. The proposed framework consists of approaches and methods that are expected to enhance access to metadata especially in cultural heritage collections and be useful for those with limited knowledge on cultural heritage. The experiments were conducted on CHiC2013 which is a collection on cultural heritage.

Thereby the capabilities of these features to detect the presence of injury can be assessed. The proposed method consists of two stages. In the first (training) stage, gait analysis is performed. A two-dimensional five-link biped model used for imitating human gait locomotion is employed to demonstrate that functions containing kinematic data of lower extremities, including knee and hip flexion/extension angles and angular velocities, characterize the gait system dynamics. Knee angle-hip angle cyclograms, knee and hip angle-angular velocity phase portraits visually demonstrate the significant disparity of gait dynamics between the lower extremities of patients with unilateral ACL deficiency. Gait dynamics underlying gait patterns of ACL-D and ACL-I knees are locally accurately modeled and approximated by radial basis function (RBF) neural networks via deterministic learning theory. The derived knowledge of approximated gait dynamics is preserved in constant RBF networks. In the second (classification) stage, a bank of dynamical estimators is constructed using the preserved constant RBF networks to represent the learned training gait patterns. By comparing the set of estimators with a test gait pattern, the generated average L1norms of errors are taken as the disparity and classification measure between the training and test gait patterns to differentiate between ACL-D and ACL-I knees.

Modular neural networks (MNNs) are neural networks that embody the concepts and principles of modularity. MNNs adopt a large number of different techniques for achieving modularization. Previous surveys of modularization techniques are relatively scarce in their systematic analysis of MNNs, focusing mostly on empirical comparisons and lacking an extensive taxonomical framework. In this review, we aim to establish a solid taxonomy that captures the essential properties and relationships of the different variants of MNNs.

Comprehending gait parameters is an essential requirement for studying the causes of knee disorders. The aim of this work is to develop a new method to distinguish between asymptomatic (AS) and osteoarthritic knee gait patterns using gait analysis via deterministic learning. Spatiotemporal parameters and three-dimensional knee joint rotations and translations are measured and compared in 19 patients with knee OA and 28 AS control subjects during level walking. The classification approach consists of two stages: a training stage and a classification stage. In the training stage, gait features representing gait dynamics, including knee rotations and translations, are derived from the kinematic data of the knees in six-degree-of-freedom. Gait dynamics underlying gait patterns of AS control subjects and patients with knee OA are locally accurately approximated by radial basis function (RBF) neural networks. The obtained knowledge of approximated gait dynamics is stored in constant RBF networks. Gait patterns of AS control subjects and patients with knee OA constitute a training set. In the classification stage, a bank of dynamical estimators is constructed for all the training gait patterns. Prior knowledge of gait dynamics represented by the constant RBF networks is embedded in the estimators. By comparing the set of estimators with a test knee OA gait pattern to be classified, a set of classification errors are generated. The average L1 norms of the errors are taken as the classification measure between the dynamics of the training gait patterns and the dynamics of the test knee OA gait pattern according to the smallest error principle. Finally, experiments are carried out to demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively separate the gait patterns between the groups of AS control subjects and patients with knee OA. By using the two-fold cross-validation and leave-one-out cross-validation styles, the correct classification rates for knee OA gait patterns are reported to be 95.7 and 97.9%, respectively.",,,,,,"Zeng, Wei/0000-0002-8353-8265; Ma, Limin/0000-0002-1299-3367",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,JUN,2019.0,52.0,1,,,,,449.0,467,,10.1007/s10462-018-9645-z,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000468576800017,0

Frogs are greatly important to improve the global ecosystem and it is ever more necessary to monitor frog biodiversity. One way to monitor frog biodiversity is to record audio of frog calls. Various methods have been developed to classify these calls. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is still no paper that reviews and summarizes currently developed methods. This survey gives a quantitative and detailed analysis of frog call classification. To be specific, a frog call classification system consists of signal pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification. Signal pre-processing is made up of signal processing, noise reduction, and syllable segmentation. Following signal preprocessing, the next step is feature extraction, which is the most crucial step for improving classification performance. Features used for frog call classification are categorized into four types: (1) time domain and frequency domain features (we classify time domain and frequency domain features into one type because they are often combined together to achieve higher classification accuracy), (2) time-frequency features, (3) cepstral features, and (4) other features.

This paper elaborates the mapping of class expressions of concepts and contributes an algorithm for their merging in an automatic ontology merging process without any human intervention. However, the challenge of mapping axiomatic definitions is the most difficult task for merging concept definitions of the source ontologies, but it reveals significant increase in precision and recall values.

The results obtained show that DE convergence speeds were faster than the ones of multiple population genetic algorithm and genetic algorithms, therefore DE algorithm seems to be a promising approach to engineering optimization problems. On the other hand, CSA demonstrated good performance at the level of pattern recognition, since the recognition rate was equal to 99.11% for IRIS database and 76.11% for TIMIT.

Our RASCAL recommender agent tracks usage histories of a group of developers to recommend to an individual developer components that are expected to be needed by that developer. Unlike many traditional recommender systems, we may recommend items that the developer has actually employed previously. We introduce a content-based filtering technique for ordering the set of recommended software components and present a comparative analysis of applying this technique to a number of collaborative filtering algorithms.

This approach optimally exploits functional properties of a Boolean function in order to find an associated multilevel circuit representation having a very short delay by using simple two input gates. The machine learning process is based on the Boolean Differential Calculus and is focused on the aim of detecting the profitable functional properties available for the Boolean function. For clear understanding the bi- decomposition of completely specified Boolean functions is introduced first. Significantly better chance of success are given for bi- decomposition of incompletely specified Boolean functions, discussed secondly. The inclusion of the weak bi-decomposition allows to prove the the completeness of the suggested decomposition method. The basic task for machine learning consists of determining the decomposition type and dedicated sets of variables. Lean on this knowledge a complete recursive design algorithm is suggested. Experimental results over MCNC benchmarks show that the bi- decomposition outperforms SIS and other BDD- based decomposition methods in terms of area and delay of the resulting circuits with comparable CPU time. By switching from the ON- set/ OFF- set model of Boolean function lattices to their upper- and lower- bound model a new view to the bi- decomposition arises.

Under this view research in image and language understanding must confront common issues that arise as a task is pursued.

We argue that a model may be maintained by incorporating changes in the scene that can be characterized at a high level of abstraction yet manifest themselves at relatively low levels of analysis.

However, the existing inference-based complete algorithms that use local eliminations cannot be applied to ADCOPs, as the (pseudo) parents are required to transfer their private functions to their (pseudo) children to perform the local eliminations optimally. Rather than disclosing private functions explicitly to facilitate local eliminations, we solve the problem by enforcing delayed eliminations and propose the first inference-based complete algorithm for ADCOPs, named AsymDPOP. To solve the severe scalability problems incurred by delayed eliminations, we propose to reduce the memory consumption by propagating a set of smaller utility tables instead of a joint utility table, and the computation efforts by sequential eliminations instead of joint eliminations. To ensure the proposed algorithms can scale up to large-scale problems under the limited memory, we combine them with the memory-bounded inference by iteratively propagating the memory-bounded utility tables with the instantiation of cycle-cut (CC) nodes, where we propose to reduce the redundancy in bounded utility iterative propagation by enumerating CC nodes in different branches independently and propagating the utility tables within the memory limit only once.

Traditionally, detection of cardiac arrhythmia based on the visual inspection of electrocardiography (ECG) signals by cardiologists is tedious, laborious and subjective. To overcome such disadvantages, numerous arrhythmia detection techniques including signal processing and machine learning tools have been developed. However, there still remain the problems of automatic detection with high efficiency and accuracy in distinguishing different myocardial dysfunctions through ECG signals. In this study we propose a novel technique for automatic detection of cardiac arrhythmia in one-lead ECG signals based upon complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD), discrete wavelet transform (DWT), phase space reconstruction (PSR) and neural networks. First, ECG signals are decomposed into a series of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) by using the CEEMD method without the preprocessing of QRS detection. The IMF6 and IMF7 of the ECG signals are extracted, which contain the majority of the ECG signals' energy and are considered to be the predominant IMFs. Second, four levels DWT is employed to decompose the predominant IMFs into different frequency bands, in which third-order Daubechies (db3) wavelet function is selected as reference variable for analysis. Third, phase space of the reference variable is reconstructed based on db3, in which the properties associated with the nonlinear ECG system dynamics are preserved. Three-dimensional (3D) PSR together with Euclidean distance (ED) has been utilized to derive features, which demonstrate significant difference in ECG system dynamics between normal versus abnormal individual heartbeats. Fourth, neural networks are then used to model, identify and classify ECG system dynamics between normal (healthy) and arrhythmia ECG signals. Finally, experiments are carried out on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, in which 436 ECG signal fragments for one lead (MLII) from 28 persons of five classes of heart beats were extracted. By using the 10-fold cross-validation style, the achieved average classification accuracy is reported to be 98.81%. Compared with various state-of-the-art methods, the results demonstrate superior performance and the proposed method can serve as a potential candidate for the automatic detection of myocardial dysfunction in the clinical application.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s10462-022-10262-w,0.0,,SEP 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000850382900001,0

Most of the developed control systems for structural vibration control have difficulties in dealing with these kinds of strong ground motions regarding the deficiencies of the human knowledge-based control systems such as fuzzy logic controllers for this purpose. Hence, the optimization of these controllers has been concerned in recent years. The main aim of this paper is to optimize the fuzzy controllers implemented in steel structures with nonlinear behavior in which the arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA) is utilized as the main optimization algorithm while an improved version of this algorithm as IAOA is also proposed for performance enhancement of the standard algorithm. In the IAOA, a new parameter identification process is proposed in which the Levy flight as a well-known stochastic process with step length determined by levy distribution is implemented in the main loop of the AOA. The IAOA and AOA are utilized for optimization of the membership functions and the rule base of the fuzzy controllers implemented in a large-scale building structure. The overall performance of the IAOA is compared with the standard AOA and other metaheuristics. The obtained results of the improved method demonstrate the capability of this method in providing very competitive solutions which results in decreasing structural responses and damages of the considered building in dealing with the near-fault strong ground motions.",,,,,,"Azizi, Mahdi/0000-0002-2364-2757",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,JUN,2022.0,55.0,5,,,,,4041.0,4075,,10.1007/s10462-021-10101-4,0.0,,DEC 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000724637800001,0

The overinflated stock market bubble will undoubtedly increase the risk of the stock market, seriously threaten the stability of the financial system, and even bring disastrous consequences to the economic system. Therefore, the stock market bubble warning evaluation is very important. In the case of considering stock market bubble warning evaluation, the fundamental issues involve strong fuzziness. Picture fuzzy set, depicted by three memberships (positive membership, neutral membership and negative membership), is a more resultful means for capturing fuzziness. In this paper, the novel picture fuzzy score function is given for dealing the comparison problem. Then, the objective weights are calculated by Renyi entropy method. Meanwhile, we develop combined weights, which can reflect both subjective preference and objective preference.

In this context, a large number of OSN textual posts concerning major cancer types are automatically scraped and structured using natural language processing techniques. Machines are trained to assign multiple labels to these posts based on the type of knowledge enclosed, if any. Trained machines are used to automatically classify large-scale textual posts. Statistical inferences are made based on these predictions to extract general concepts and abstract knowledge. Different approaches for constructing document feature vectors showed no tangible effect on the classification accuracy. Among different classifiers, logistic regression achieved the highest overall accuracy (96.4%) and (F1) over bar (73.4) in a 13-way multi-label classification of textual posts. The most common topic was seeking or providing moral support for cancer patients, followed by providing technical information about cancer causes and treatments. The most common causes and treatments of different types of cancer on OSN are also automatically detected in this study. Seeking or providing moral support for cancer patients shared the largest overlap with other topics, i.e. moral support tends to be present even in OSN posts which focus on other topics. On the other hand, providing technical information about cancer diagnosis or prevention were the most isolated topics, where OSN posts tend not to allude to other topics. OSN posts which seek financial support only overlap with the moral support topic, if any. Our methodology and results provide public health professionals with an opportunity to monitor what topics and to which extent are being discussed on OSN, what specific information and knowledge are being disseminated over OSN, and to assess their veracity in close to real time.

Face recognition is a subset of biometric recognition. Face verification and identification processes are prone to plastic surgery challenges which are commonly used nowadays to alter facial features for good looking demonstration. With increasing trend in technology and intellect robust biometric recognition systems are developed for human recognition after plastic surgery. However, these systems have some limitations because recognition after plastic surgery is affected by lightning, aging, pose, expressions, disguise and occlusion effects. In this survey, we aim to highlight the mitigating effects of cutting edge plastic surgical operations. These procedures lead to medical identity thefts, which is a serious offense for human community as an individual's identity is forged. Thus, this makes one's safety a critical issue and human recognition after plastic surgery a crucial challenge. Since the existing methods for human recognition after plastic surgical operations are not promising, in the current scenario plastic surgical operations secure above facial recognition. A number of existing biometric recognition algorithms for face images have been opted such as principal component analysis, Fisher/linear discriminant analysis, local feature analysis, local/circular binary patterns, speeded up robust features, granular system, correlation based approach, evolutionary granular/genetic approach, grouping recognition by parts and sparse demonstration approach, geometrical face recognition after plastic surgery, feature/texture based fusion scheme and deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN). The validation metrics used for the evaluation of recognition techniques are expected error rate, recognition rate, half total error rate and F-score. All algorithms are tested on an open plastic surgery facial dataset containing 1800 before and after surgery image samples pertaining to 900 humans. For a particular human being, two front facing image samples with appropriate luminance and unbiased gesture are taken: the former is taken pre cosmetic procedure and the latter is taken post cosmetic procedure. It has been deduced that feature and texture based fusion approach gives best results till date. It is predicted that DCNN has full potential of giving consistent results on surgical databases as it is already validated on non surgical databases.

This increase has in turn led to much wider deployment of surveillance cameras worldwide, and consequently, automated surveillance systems research has received more attention from the scientific community than before. Concurrently, biometrics research has become more popular as well, and it is supported by the increasing number of approaches devised to address specific degradation factors of unconstrained environments. Despite these recent efforts, no automated surveillance system that performs reliable biometric recognition in such an environment has become available. Nevertheless, recent developments in human motion analysis and biometric recognition suggest that both can be combined to develop a fully automated system. As such, this paper reviews recent advances in both areas, with a special focus on surveillance scenarios. When compared to previous studies, we highlight two distinct features, i.e., (1) our emphasis is on approaches that are devised to work in unconstrained environments and surveillance scenarios; and (2) biometric recognition is the final goal of the surveillance system, as opposed to behavior analysis, anomaly detection or action recognition.",,,,,"Neves, João/G-6477-2016; Proença, Hugo/F-9499-2010; Narducci, Fabio/R-5833-2017; Barra, Silvio/J-8577-2019","Neves, João/0000-0003-0139-2213; Proença, Hugo/0000-0003-2551-8570; Narducci, Fabio/0000-0003-4879-7138; Barra, Silvio/0000-0003-4042-3000",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,DEC,2016.0,46.0,4,,,,,515.0,541,,10.1007/s10462-016-9474-x,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000387221300005,0

In this context, differential evolution (DE) is optimized by employing different approaches belonging to different research directions. The focus of the current review is on two main directions: (a) the replacement of manual control parameter setting with adaptive and self-adaptive methods; and (b) hybridization with other algorithms. The control parameters have a big influence on the algorithms performance, their correct setting being a crucial aspect when striving to obtain optimal solutions. Since their values are problem dependent, setting them is not an easy task. The trial and error method initially used is time and resource consuming, and in the same time, does not guarantee optimal results. Therefore, new approaches were proposed, the automatic control being one of the best solution developed by researchers. Concerning hybridization, the scope was to combine two or more algorithms in order to eliminate or to reduce the drawbacks of each individual algorithm. In this manner, different combinations at different levels were proposed. This work presents the main approaches mixing DE with global algorithms, DE with local algorithms and DE with global and local algorithms.

The main objective of this effort is to explore the utility of a neural network-based approach to the recognition of the hand gestures. A unique multi-layer perception of neural network is built for classification by using back-propagation learning algorithm. The goal of static hand gesture recognition is to classify the given hand gesture data represented by some features into some predefined finite number of gesture classes. The proposed system presents a recognition algorithm to recognize a set of six specific static hand gestures, namely: Open, Close, Cut, Paste, Maximize, and Minimize. The hand gesture image is passed through three stages, preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. In preprocessing stage some operations are applied to extract the hand gesture from its background and prepare the hand gesture image for the feature extraction stage. In the first method, the hand contour is used as a feature which treats scaling and translation of problems (in some cases). The complex moment algorithm is, however, used to describe the hand gesture and treat the rotation problem in addition to the scaling and translation. The algorithm used in a multi-layer neural network classifier which uses back-propagation learning algorithm.

The expressive power of temporal databases/query languages has been studied from different perspectives, but the kind of temporal information they are able to store and retrieve is not always conveniently addressed. Here we assess a number of temporal query languages with respect to the modelling of time intervals, interval relationships and states, which can be thought of as the building blocks to represent and reason about a large and important class of historic information. To survey the facilities and issues which are particular to certain temporal query languages not only gives an idea about how useful they can be in particular contexts, but also gives an interesting insight in how these issues are, in many cases, ultimately inherent to the database paradigm. While in the area of AI declarative languages are usually the preferred choice, other areas of CS heavily rely on the extended relational paradigm. This paper, then, will be concerned with the representation of historic information in two well known temporal query languages: Templog in the context of temporal deductive databases, and TSQL2 in the context of temporal relational databases.

In particular, a method to regulate the use of classical genetic operators and to define new more pertinent ones is proposed, taking advantage of a building block structured representation of the explored space. A hierarchical approach resting on multiple levels of cooperative metaheuristics is finally presented, leading to the definition of a complete concerted cooperation strategy. Some applications of these concepts to difficult proteomics problems, including automatic protein identification, biological motif inference and multiple sequence alignment are presented. For each application, an innovative method based on the cooperation concept is given and compared with classical approaches. In the protein identification problem, a first level of cooperation using swarm intelligence is applied to the comparison of mass spectrometric data with biological sequence database, followed by a genetic programming method to discover an optimal scoring function. The multiple sequence alignment problem is decomposed in three steps involving several evolutionary processes to infer different kind of biological motifs and a concerted cooperation strategy to build the sequence alignment according to their motif content.",,,,,,"Gras, Robin/0000-0002-0563-0250",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,OCT,2003.0,20.0,1-2,,,,,95.0,120,,10.1023/A:1026080413328,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000185826400006,0

An effective e-commerce catalog must map user needs to products that can fulfill them. This paper describes an interactive, incremental, case-based, critiquing approach to solving this problem. The approach is interactive and incremental, so it does not require that the user have a completely specified need at the start. The system is case-based in that it emphasizes products over features or constraints, and uses case-based reasoning techniques for its product retrieval.

Like other metaheuristic methods, it suffers from the disadvantages of being stuck in local areas, suffering from weak exploitation abilities, and an inability to maintain a balance between exploration and exploitation. To overcome these weaknesses, a new hybrid Mutualism Archimedes Optimization Algorithm (MAOA) method has been proposed by combining the AOA and the mutation phase in the Symbiosis organism search (SOS) method. SOS algorithm is known for its exploitation ability. With the mutation phase, it has been used to improve local search for swarm agents, help prevent premature convergence and increase population diversity. To verify the applicability and performance of the proposed algorithm, extensive analysis of standard benchmark functions, CEC'17 test suites, and engineering design problems were performed. The proposed method is compared with the recently emerged and popular AOA, SOS, Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO), COOT Optimization Algorithm (COOT), Aquila Optimizer (AO), Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA), and Multi-Verse Optimization (MVO) methods, and statistical analyses were performed. The results obtained from the experiments show that the proposed MAOA method has superior global search performance and faster convergence speed compared to AOA, SOS, and other recently emerged and popular metaheuristic methods. Furthermore, this study compares MAOA to five well-established and recent algorithms constructed using various metaheuristic methodologies utilizing nine benchmark datasets to assess the general competence of MAOA in feature selection.

Second, they consider only the influence of contextual keywords on sentiment polarity, ignoring the importance of key phrases in a sentence. To address these issues, a phrase-aware neural network based on fine-grained attention,referred to as FAPN, is proposed. The FAPN employs a convolutional neural network to extract phrase representations in the context and concatenates the representations with the corresponding word vector as input. Additionally, a fine-grained attention module is designed to generate aspect-specific representations by capturing the word-level interactions between the aspect and the sentence. Extensive experiments on five widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FAPN method.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,JUN,2022.0,55.0,5,,,,,3727.0,3746,,10.1007/s10462-021-10080-6,0.0,,NOV 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000719713300002,0

This study focuses on deep learning algorithms since they seem to outperform their machine learning alternatives consistently.

Existing hierarchical classification methods based on granular computing can effectively reduce the computational complexity by considering the granularity of classes. However, their predictive accuracy is affected by inter-level error propagation within the hierarchy. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical classification method with multi-path selection based on coarse- and fine-grained class relationships, which mitigates the inter-level error propagation problem. Firstly, we use a top-down recursive method to calculate the probabilities of the hierarchical classes by logistic regression classification. Secondly, the current class probability is calculated by combining the parent and current classes probabilities. We select multiple possible fine-grained classes at the current level according to their sibling relationships. Compared with existing methods, the proposed method reduces the possibility of misclassification from the upper layer. Finally, the multi-path prediction result is provided to a classical classifier for final prediction.

This paper provides a review of the literature on feature selection techniques specifically designed for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and hidden Markov models (HMMs), two common parametric latent variable models. The primary contribution of this work is the collection and grouping of feature selection methods specifically designed for GMMs and for HMMs. An additional contribution lies in outlining the connections between these two groups of feature selection methods. Often, feature selection methods for GMMs and HMMs are treated as separate topics. In this survey, we propose that methods developed for one model can be adapted to the other model. Further, we find that the number of feature selection methods for GMMs outweighs the number of methods for HMMs and that the proportion of methods for HMMs that require supervised data is larger than the proportion of GMM methods that require supervised data. We conclude that further research into unsupervised feature selection methods for HMMs is required and that established methods for GMMs could be adapted to HMMs. It should be noted that feature selection can also be referred to as dimensionality reduction, variable selection, attribute selection, and variable subset reduction. In this paper, we make a distinction between dimensionality reduction and feature selection. Dimensionality reduction, which we do not consider, is any process that reduces the number of features used in a model and can include methods that transform features in order to reduce the dimensionality. Feature selection, by contrast, is a specific form of dimensionality reduction that eliminates feature as inputs into the model. The primary difference is that dimensionality reduction can still require the collection of all the data sources in order to transform and reduce the feature set, while feature selection eliminates the need to collect the irrelevant data sources.",,,,,,"Beling, Peter/0000-0003-2196-6982",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,OCT,2019.0,52.0,3,,,,,1739.0,1779,,10.1007/s10462-017-9581-3,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000486256400007,0

For this reason, a novel machine learning hybrid methodology, called (Evolutionary Kalman Mathematical Modelling-EvoKalMaModel), was used to achieve an accurate and interpretable scoring methodology.

One of the main causes is that no significant method of assessment of risk of battery depletion has yet been proposed. As a result decision of redirection to a charging station is fixed and takes into account neither a dynamic evaluation of the risk of battery depletion nor an evaluation of the gain, defined as the level of mission accomplishment that could be achieved. In this paper we propose a novel method for evaluation of risk of battery depletion for mobile robots. Uncertainties concerning effective battery capacity, current discharge rate and energy required for reaching the station are addressed by the use of probability density functions. This risk assessment will allow replacing the usage of battery threshold by a customizable risk-taking parameter that will be used to define what level of gain is required for balancing a given level of risk. This risk/gain management of battery will guarantee that decision of redirection to the station corresponds to a favorable compromise between risk and level of mission accomplishment.

A major bottleneck in electronic communications is the enormous dissemination of unwanted, harmful emails known as spam emails. A major concern is the developing of suitable filters that can adequately capture those emails and achieve high performance rate. Machine learning (ML) researchers have developed many approaches in order to tackle this problem. Within the context of machine learning, support vector machines (SVM) have made a large contribution to the development of spam email filtering. Based on SVM, different schemes have been proposed through text classification approaches (TC). A crucial problem when using SVM is the choice of kernels as they directly affect the separation of emails in the feature space. This paper presents thorough investigation of several distance-based kernels and specify spam filtering behaviors using SVM. The majority of used kernels in recent studies concern continuous data and neglect the structure of the text. In contrast to classical kernels, we propose the use of various string kernels for spam filtering. We show how effectively string kernels suit spam filtering problem. On the other hand, data preprocessing is a vital part of text classification where the objective is to generate feature vectors usable by SVM kernels. We detail a feature mapping variants in TC that yield improved performance for the standard SVM in filtering task. Furthermore, to cope for realtime scenarios we propose an online active framework for spam filtering. We present empirical results from an extensive study of online, transductive, and online active methods for classifying spam emails in real time.

In this paper, variations of the firefighting paradigm developed by Lewandowsky and his colleagues, which initiated research about KP, were used to explore the psychological plausibility of MOE in general and POLE in particular. In a first experiment, these statements were tested by modifying the test display of the firefighting paradigm. The results showed that adding irrelevant information to the display resulted in a smaller proportion of partitioning participants. Also, some participants used non-linear experts to partition the stimulus space. This new type of KP was further explored in a second study, which included more training sessions.

We identify a number of problems in the application of Kohonen networks for Information Retrieval, most notably scalability, reliability and retrieval effectiveness. To solve these problems we propose to use the Growing Cell Structures network, a variant of the Kohonen network which shows a more flexible adaptation to the domain structure. This network was tested on two standard test-collections, using a combined recall and precision measure, and compared to traditional IR methods such as the Vector Space Model and various clustering algorithms. The network performs at a competitive level of effectiveness, and is suitable for visualization purposes. However, the incremental training procedures for the networks result in a reliability problem, and the approach is computationally intensive. Also, the utility of the resulting maps for navigation will need further improvement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,OCT,1996.0,10.0,5-6,,,,,477.0,504,,10.1007/BF00130695,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996VQ25600005,0

The fact that no clustering algorithm can solve all clustering problems has resulted in the development of several clustering algorithms with diverse applications. We review data clustering, intending to underscore recent applications in selected industrial sectors and other notable concepts. In this paper, we begin by highlighting clustering components and discussing classification terminologies. Furthermore, specific, and general applications of clustering are discussed. Notable concepts on clustering algorithms, emerging variants, measures of similarities/dissimilarities, issues surrounding clustering optimization, validation and data types are outlined. Suggestions are made to emphasize the continued interest in clustering techniques both by scholars and Industry practitioners. Key findings in this review show the size of data as a classification criterion and as data sizes for clustering become larger and varied, the determination of the optimal number of clusters will require new feature extracting methods, validation indices and clustering techniques.

To be specific, firstly, the proposed WSDEN learns sentiment maps with a weakly supervised technology, thus it significantly reduces the annotation burden and encourages features to convey more sentiment information. Secondly, to solve the problem of overemphasis on local information mentioned above, Discriminate Enhancement Map is constructed by spatial weighting and channel weighting, which combines the sentiment map to perform sentiment enhancement on the final deep features of images.

In extreme situations, the complexity of the description of vehicles' movement on routes may cause by two poles: the imprecision of movement time and the uncertainty of the possibility of movement on roads. Traditionally, a fuzzy value has been used to represent the data's impreciseness; hence, only one pole of expert's information is taken in the aggregation results. The main objective of this paper is to present an efficient way for fuzzy vehicle routing modeling to minimize the decision-making risks in the optimal planning of routes network and from distribution centers to demand points. To address this, a new two-stage possibilistic bi-criteria vehicle routing problem (VRP) is presented under extreme conditions. In the first stage, the sample of so-called promising closed routes are selected based on a constructive approach using a simulation algorithm. The expected times of the vehicle movement between demand points are taken as fuzzy triangular numbers. In the second stage, based on Choquet integral's, a bi-criteria partitioning model for the fuzzy VRP has been constructed. The constraint approach has been defined to obtain the optimal solution of the model. For numerical experiments, a parallel algorithm is created based on D. Knuth's algorithm of dancing links.

On this basis, this paper propounds the notion of penalty weights to characterize dominated relations for acquiring the measurement of comprehensive disagreement and constituting a likelihood-based consensus ranking model. The primary contributions of this study are fourfold. Firstly, two useful point operators are initiated for upper and lower estimations towards Pythagorean membership grades. Secondly, an effective likelihood measure is exploited for determining outranking relations of Pythagorean fuzzy information. Thirdly, a pragmatic concept of penalty weights is proposed for characterizing the dominated relations among alternatives and measuring degrees of comprehensive disagreement.

The heterogeneous physiological characteristics of the ECG signal recorded from the heart make it challenging to implement an efficient diagnostic system. Therefore, this paper proposes a new approach to handling the heterogeneous characteristics of heart rate variability (HRV) with an absolute magnitude deviation analysis and an integrated machine learning technique for prediabetes prediction. We conducted an oral glucose tolerance test to acquire a resting-state ECG signal and the corresponding blood glucose value. We analyzed the HRV pattern from the ECG signal with a block-sliding window technique. We proposed a hybrid model to classify normal and prediabetes based on the extent of the absolute deviation of HRV values and avoiding a single point of failure. We adopted the model from the classification and regression tree (CART) and neural network (NN) algorithms. The experimental results reveal that when the blood glucose level increases, the maximum and range values of CARTHRV decreases while the minimum value increases. The proposed hybrid model had a better performance than the two methods with 100% sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score measures against CART and NN that recorded < 100% for the same number of prediabetes in the training and test sets. The outcome from the analysis shows that the changes in blood glucose can be observed in ECG signals. The fast approximation of the proposed method to 100% accuracy suggests that it is possible to achieve the diagnosis of prediabetes and overcome the discrepancies in physiological signals among individuals.",,,,,,"Tobore, Igbe/0000-0002-8216-9576",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,MAR,2022.0,55.0,3,,,,,2221.0,2244,,10.1007/s10462-021-10040-0,0.0,,AUG 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000687962600001,0

In this article, we empirically show that exploitation of xor, xnor, eq, and not gates is a key factor behind the performance of local search algorithms using single variable flips when adapted to logic gate constraints. Moreover, controlled experiments and investigations into the variables selected for flipping further elucidates these findings. To achieve these conclusions, we have adapted the AdaptNovelty+ and CCANr algorithms to cope with logic gate-based constraint models. These are two prominent families of local search algorithms for satisfiability. We performed our experiments using a large set of benchmark instances from SATLib, SAT2014, and SAT2020.

Nowadays, most of the problems are transforming from logical solutions into statistical domains. This requires the implementation of machine learning algorithms to mine useful data from the statistical datasets which in turn demands high-end computing. Generally, machine learning algorithms utilize Gradient Descent as a tool to find the optimal solution of computationally expensive problems. This gave rise to the development of optimization algorithms like Momentum, RMSProp, Adam and the like, which could speed up the convergence to the global optimum besides increasing the learning accuracy. However, nowadays the supervised machine learning models got more data intensive which increased their computational cost, putting the efficiency of these algorithms into question. In this context, a new optimization algorithm namely, the Tangent-Cut Optimizer (TC-Opt) has been proposed which can converge faster than the traditional optimization algorithms for supervised machine learning models. Furthermore, the proposed work brings forward a phenomenon that intertwines the statistical and logical decision-making model into a single unit while shedding light on a new heuristic approach named Hybrid Heuristics. The proposed algorithm has been implemented on the standard dataset of Boston House Pricing Dataset for linear regression and MNIST image dataset of handwritten digits from 0 to 9 for logistic regression and its performance has been compared with the existing algorithms.

As confirmed by many studies, breast cancer screening using mammography can reduce breast cancer-related mortality by 30-70%. However, although the interpretation of mammography images by a second reader has been shown to increase the cancer detection rate, this practice is not widespread due to the cost associated. As a result, computer-aided detection/diagnosis (CAD) of breast mammography has been gaining popularity with various studies illustrating the positive effects of using computers in detecting early breast cancer signs by providing the radiologists with a second opinion with most of these CAD systems requiring the breast outline and pectoral muscle regions (in images acquired using Medio-Lateral-Oblique view) to be segmented from mammograms prior to the classification. This paper discusses recent developments and methods proposed for segmenting the breast and pectoral muscle regions and compares the performance and shortcomings of different approaches grouped together based on the techniques used. While it is arduous to compare these methods using comparative analysis, a set of common performance evaluation criterion is defined in this study and various methods are compared based on their methodology and the validation dataset used. Although many methods can achieve promising results, there is still room for further development, especially in pre-processing and image enhancement steps where most methods do not take the necessary steps for ensuring a smooth segmentation of boundaries.

They are designed to optimize over a space of very high or infinite dimensional policies. As a matter of fact, they are known to suffer from a large variance problem. This critical issue comes from the fact that updating the current policy is based on a functional gradient that does not exploit all old episodes sampled by previous policies. In this paper, we introduce a generalized RKHS policy gradient algorithm that integrates the following important ideas: (i) policy modeling in RKHS; (ii) normalized importance sampling, which helps reduce the estimation variance by reusing previously sampled episodes in a principled way; and (iii) regularization terms, which avoid updating the policy too over-fit to sampled data. In the experiment section, we provide an analysis of the proposed algorithms through bench-marking domains. The experiment results show that the proposed algorithm can still enjoy a powerful policy modeling in RKHS and achieve more data-efficiency.",,,,,,"Le Pham, Tuyen/0000-0002-1345-2650",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,OCT,2019.0,52.0,3,,,,,2039.0,2059,,10.1007/s10462-017-9579-x,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000486256400016,0

Semantic detection is a sub-category of sentiment analysis which deals with the identification of sentiment orientation in any text. Many sentiment applications rely on lexicons to supply features to a model. Various machine learning algorithms and sentiment lexicons have been proposed in research in order to improve sentiment categorization. Supervised machine learning algorithms and domain specific sentiment lexicons generally perform better as compared to the unsupervised or semi-supervised domain independent lexicon based approaches. The core hindrance in the application of supervised algorithms or domain specific sentiment lexicons is the unavailability of sentiment labeled training datasets for every domain. On the other hand, the performance of algorithms based on general purpose sentiment lexicons needs improvement. This research is focused on building a general purpose sentiment lexicon in a semi-supervised manner.

From the review, it appears that no one development model is referred to as a standard or preferred model for web application development. However, agile development models seem to have gained more attention, probably due to the multiple stakeholders that are involved in discussing security viewpoints, rather than a few members of the development team.

Each robot agent makes its own decision based on its internal information as well as information broadcast to it by other robots about events such as intruder sighting. As a result the multi-robot security system is distributive without a central coordinator.

They are becoming increasingly popular models as part of prediction systems in finance, marketing, bio-informatics, speech recognition, signal processing, and so on. However, traditional HMMs do not allow people and model owners to generate predictions without disclosing their private information to each other. To address the increasing needs for privacy, this work identifies and studies the private prediction problem; it is demonstrated with the following scenario: Bob has a private HMM, while Alice has a private input; and she wants to use Bob's model to make a prediction based on her input. However, Alice does not want to disclose her private input to Bob, while Bob wants to prevent Alice from deriving information about his model. How can Alice and Bob perform HMMs-based predictions without violating their privacy? We propose privacy-preserving protocols to produce predictions on HMMs without greatly exposing Bob's and Alice's privacy. We then analyze our schemes in terms of accuracy, privacy, and performance. Since they are conflicting goals, due to privacy concerns, it is expected that accuracy or performance might degrade. However, our schemes make it possible for Bob and Alice to produce the same predictions efficiently while preserving their privacy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,JUN,2010.0,34.0,1,,,,,53.0,72,,10.1007/s10462-010-9161-2,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000278347500004,0

It was originally developed as an analysis tool in biomechanics research, but has grown increasingly important as a source of motion data for computer animation. In this context it has been widely used for both cinema and video games. Hand motion capture and tracking in particular has received a lot of attention because of its critical role in the design of new Human Computer Interaction methods and gesture analysis. One of the main difficulties is the capture of human hand motion. This paper gives an overview of ongoing research HandPuppet3D being carried out in collaboration with an animation studio to employ computer vision techniques to develop a prototype desktop system and associated animation process that will allow an animator to control 3D character animation through the use of hand gestures. The eventual goal of the project is to support existing practice by providing a softer, more intuitive, user interface for the animator that improves the productivity of the animation workflow and the quality of the resulting animations. To help achieve this goal the focus has been placed on developing a prototype camera based desktop gesture capture system to capture hand gestures and interpret them in order to generate and control the animation of 3D character models. This will allow an animator to control 3D character animation through the capture and interpretation of hand gestures. Methods will be discussed for motion tracking and capture in 3D animation and in particular that of hand motion tracking and capture. HandPuppet3D aims to enable gesture capture with interpretation of the captured gestures and control of the target 3D animation software. This involves development and testing of a motion analysis system built from algorithms recently developed.

In an agent-based peer-to-peer network, member agents are capable of giving and following referrals to each other. This results in the emergence of communities where agents directly interact with other neighboring agents that supply the required service or will refer the right source. The notion of referral networks, as presented in the work of (Yolum and Singh, Proceedings of the Second International Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems, pp 592-599, 2003), and their application to knowledge management, lacks two fundamental aspects; the relation of concepts within a domain, and the ability of an agent to dynamically change their interests based on suggestions in the form of concept relations. This paper introduces the concept of an oracle agent, which is an agent with relational concept knowledge that can supply suggestions to a querying agent on how to adapt their interests. Additionally the notion of health and localized trust automata are used to aid agents in discriminating useful pieces of concept knowledge. These new features allow agents to search in new ways so as to achieve superior results and as a consequence outperform agents in a traditional referral network.

Similarly, organizations typically use different types of knowledge to enhance their performance. Commonsense knowledge that is not well formalized modeling is the key to disaster management in the process of information gathering into a formalized way. Modeling commonsense knowledge is crucial for classifying and presenting of unstructured knowledge. This paper suggests an approach to achieving this objective, by proposing a three-phase knowledge modeling approach. At the initial stage commonsense knowledge is converted into a questionnaire. Removing dependencies among the questions are modeled using principal component analysis. Classification of the knowledge is processed through fuzzy logic module, which is constructed on the basis of principal components. Further explanations for classified knowledge are derived by expert system technology. We have implemented the system using FLEX expert system shell, SPSS, XML, and VB.

As support for this theory, they found that modifiers typically associated with the instantiated relation are interpreted reliably faster than those whose modifiers are less frequently associated with the relation. The CARIN theory explains this phenomenon by proposing that people store statistical distributions regarding the frequency with which modifying nouns have combined with each relation in the past. However, we maintain that an association between relation frequency and response time does not imply a causal influence. In this study we explore whether the effects observed by Gagne and Shoben were caused by the influence of relation frequency per se. Two experiments were conducted in which experiential knowledge about the modifier was controlled. The first experiment involved combinations whose modifiers were relatively rare and the second involved the presentation of nouns without a modifier-head syntax. In both of these experiments, knowledge about historical modifier usage was irrelevant. Our results show that correlations between modifier preference and response time persist even in situations where a knowledge of the modifier's history is not available. These findings provide converging evidence that the relationship between relation frequency and response time is not a causal one. Instead, an understanding of the relationship between modifier properties and usage, as appropriate to the given context, may be the dominant influence on interpretation in many circumstances. In light of this, we propose an alternative account of the factors influencing ease of interpretation.",,,,,,"Maguire, Rebecca/0000-0002-0368-4626",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,APR,2006.0,25.0,1-2,,,,,139.0,160,,10.1007/s10462-007-9020-y,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000250784500010,0

This problem originates from a local defense agency where activities to be scheduled are strongly ranked in a priority scheme determined by planners ahead of time and operational real-time demands require solutions to be available almost immediately. A hybrid framework is used which is composed of two levels. A high-level component explores different orderings of activities by priorities using Tabu Search or Genetic Algorithm heuristics, while in a low-level component, constraint programming and minimal critical sets are used to resolve conflicts. Real-data used to test the algorithm show that a larger number of high priority activities are scheduled when compared to a CP-based system used currently.

ExpertClerk was designed as a tool for developing dialogue-based front-end systems for product databases. We first analyzed conversation models of human salesclerks interacting with customers. The goal of a salesclerk is to effectively match a customer's buying points and a product's selling points. To achieve this, the salesclerk alternates between asking questions, proposing sample products, and observing the customer's responses. ExpertClerk imitates a human salesclerk. It consolidates the human shopper's requests by narrowing down a list of many products through a process of asking effective questions using entropy (navigation-by-asking) and showing contrasting samples with an explanation of their selling points (navigation-by-proposing).

We have discovered that many studies have suggested diabetes can be differentiated into subtypes clinically based on the risk complications, genetically defined, using clinical features, and for treatment selection. As for clustering algorithms, k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering were shown to be widely used in determining sub-clusters of diabetes. To further investigate diabetes subtyping, understanding the specific objective and method of diabetes subtyping using clustering algorithms from a large dataset will be crucial which could contribute to novel knowledge and improvement for diabetes management.",,,,,,"Abdul Wahab, Asnida/0000-0003-3222-1732",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s10462-022-10202-8,0.0,,AUG 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000836532300002,0

It is essentially an extension of two-way decisions (2WDs). What is the superiority of 3WDs/S3WDs over traditional 2WDs? Only a few studies have analyzed the theoretical superiority of 3WDs over traditional 2WDs. The motivation of this paper is to theoretically analyze the superiority of 3WDs over 2WDs in dealing with classification problems. From the perspective of probability, 3WDs is compared with 2WDs for a thorough discussion and analysis of the superiority of 3WDs in this paper. First, it is proved that increasing information can effectively improve classification precision in terms of the sample mean, misclassification probability, and interval of uncertain classification. Second, a novel 3WDs model/sequential three-way decisions model (3WDM-CLSM/S3WDM-CLSM) based on confidence level and sample mean is proposed, and the corresponding method for calculating the pair of thresholds based on the confidence level is presented. Third, the superiority of 3WDs compared to 2WDs is analyzed in terms of classification precision and cost of information acquisition (CIA). Finally, experiments are completed to show that the 3WDs model can effectively reduce the CIA, and its classification accuracy is close to that of the 2WDs model.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s10462-022-10203-7,0.0,,MAY 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000796346800002,0

Then 2nd-order textures are used to generate 2nd-order Texture Co-occurrence Code (2TCC). The sufficient experiments demonstrate that 2TCC yields satisfactory accuracy performance on four public databases, including contact, contactless and multi-spectral acquisition types. Moreover, in order to further improve the discrimination and robustness of 2TCC, we propose Multiple-order Texture Co-occurrence Code (MTCC), in which 1st-order Texture Co-occurrence Code (1TCC) and 2TCC are fused at score level. 1TCC is good at describing minor wrinkles; while 2TCC does well in describing principal textures.

Risk assessing CHD in a timely manner helps to stop, reverse, and reduce the spread of many chronic diseases and health hazards. This paper proposes a cloud-random forest (C-RF) model combining cloud model and random forest to assess the risk of CHD. In this model, based on the traditional classification and regression trees (CART), a weight determining algorithm based on the cloud model and decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory is applied to obtain the weights of the evaluation attributes. The attribute weight and the gain value of the smallest Gini coefficient corresponding to the same attribute are weighted and summed. The weighted sum is then used to replace the original gain value. This value rule is used as a new CART node split criterion to construct a new decision tree, thus forming a new random forest, namely, the C-RF. The Framingham dataset of the Kaggle platform is the research sample for the empirical analysis. Comparing the C-RF model with CART, support vector machine (SVM), convolutional neural network (CNN), and random forest (RF) using standard performance evaluation indexes such as accuracy, error rates, ROC curve and AUC value. The result shows that the classification accuracy of the C-RF model is 85%, which is improved by 8, 9, 4 and 3% respectively compared with CART, SVM, CNN and RF. The error rate of the first type is 13.99%, which is 6.99, 7.44, 4.47 and 3.02% lower than CART, SVM, CNN and RF respectively. The AUC value is 0.85, which is also higher than other comparison models.

In this study, the random walk phase of the original Jaya algorithm is developed and the Improved Jaya Algorithm (IJaya) is proposed. IJaya has been tested for success in eighteen classic benchmark test functions. Although the performance of the original Jaya algorithm has been tested at low dimensions in the literature, its success in large sizes has not been tested.

It has been proven that IJaya's performance has increased with the tests performed. Test results show that IJaya displays good performance and can be used as an alternative method for constrained optimization.

Biomarkers such as pupillary reactivity inform about the quantity of the information being processed. Potentially, they can improve predictions of self-criticism levels and identification of pathological levels of self-criticism. The goal of our study is to test whether changes in pupil size act as predictors of self-criticism in participants viewing facial emotional stimuli. This is a first study that includes all basic emotions, and allows detailed analyses of pupillary reactivity predictors. Our results show that the pathological form of self-criticism, which is Hated Self in The Forms of Self-Criticizing/Attacking and Self-Reassuring Scale (FSCRS), was significantly predicted by enlarged pupils in the presence of Anger and Disgust and by narrowed pupils in the presence of Happiness. Greater information gain for Disgust predicted higher score in Inadequate Self and Hated Self measures and lower score for Reassuring Self. The greater information gain for Anger predicted higher score in Inadequate Self and Hated Self measures, but not lower score for Reassuring Self. Pupillary reactivity seems to be a promising biomarker in diagnosing the level of self-criticism and self-reassurance by different pupilar reactions to facial emotion expression especially for Disgust. Greater information gain for Disgust predicts higher score in Inadequate Self and Hated Self measures and lower score for Reassuring Self.

This paper proposes a new community detection model, based on the possibilistic c-means model, by using structural as well as attribute similarities in a large scale in social networks. In the majority of real social networks, different clusters share nodes, resulting in the formation of overlapping communities. The proposed model, on the basis of structural and attribute similarity (PCMSA), serves as a fuzzy community detection model addressing the overlapping community detection problem, and detecting communities in a way that each community has a densely connected sub-graph with homogeneous attribute values. The function of the proposed model is assessed by a trade-off between intra-cluster and inter-cluster density and homogeneity. Therefore, to validate the proposed community detection algorithm (PCMSA) and its results, an index, compatible with the proposed model, is defined; and to assess the efficiency of the proposed fuzzy community detection, several experimental results in variety sizes from very small to very large sizes of real social networks are given, and the results are contrasted with other community detection models like FCAN, CODICIL, SA-cluster, K-SNAP and PCM.

Such a human-machine voice interaction in real world would often involve a noisy ambience, where humans tend to speak with additional vocal effort than in a quiet ambience, to mitigate the noise-induced suppression of vocal self-feedback. This noise induced change in the vocal effort is called Lombard speech. In order to build intelligent conversational devices that can operate in a noisy ambience, it is imperative to study the characteristics and processing of Lombard speech. Though the progress of research on Lombard speech started several decades ago, it needs to be explored further in the current scenario which is seeing an explosion of voice-driven applications. The system designed to work with normal speech spoken in a quiet ambience fails to provide the same performance in changing environmental contexts. Different contexts lead to different styles of Lombard speech and hence there arises a need for efficient ways of handling variations in speaking styles in noise. The Lombard speech is also more intelligible than normal speech of a speaker. Applications like public announcement systems with speech output interface should talk with varying degrees of vocal effort to enhance naturalness in a way that humans adapt to speak in noise, in real time.

Reconstruction algorithms entail transforming signals collected by acquisition hardware into interpretable images. Reconstruction is a challenging task given the ill-posedness of the problem and the absence of exact analytic inverse transforms in practical cases. While the last decades witnessed impressive advancements in terms of new modalities, improved temporal and spatial resolution, reduced cost, and wider applicability, several improvements can still be envisioned such as reducing acquisition and reconstruction time to reduce patient's exposure to radiation and discomfort while increasing clinics throughput and reconstruction accuracy. Furthermore, the deployment of biomedical imaging in handheld devices with small power requires a fine balance between accuracy and latency. The design of fast, robust, and accurate reconstruction algorithms is a desirable, yet challenging, research goal. While the classical image reconstruction algorithms approximate the inverse function relying on expert-tuned parameters to ensure reconstruction performance, deep learning (DL) allows automatic feature extraction and real-time inference.

With the recent progresses seen in information and communication technologies, there have been great concerns about developing personalized healthcare services that can ensure the living conditions and active aging of the elderly people. Among these technologies, we highlight and review in this work, the current state of gamification and related techniques applied to the elderly care context. Six research questions were defined to provide an overview on the current state in the development of gamified systems for elderly care through the identification of publication source types, research areas, target groups, game design elements and technologies employed and observed issues and benefits of using gamification in this context. Results have shown a great diversity in publication source types and research areas, even within the health domain. Different target groups were identified based on surrounding environment and physical and cognitive capabilities of the elderly person. Feedback, progression, rewards and social interaction enhancement are highlighted as the most relevant and frequently used game design elements for this context. Technological features observed include self-management systems, portable devices, physical robots, consoles and wearable technologies. The use of gamification techniques to support elderly people has proven to be beneficial to improve wellbeing as well as both physical, cognitive, social, and emotional state of the elderly person. Current challenges are most related with the need for traditional healthcare services to integrate gamification techniques to improve personalized healthcare and answer different necessities and adapt the support provided according to the individual capabilities of elderly people. The findings presented in this systematic literature review should be considered in the development of future personalized elderly care solutions by adapting the support provided according to interests, capabilities, necessities and contexts associated to the elderly person as a means to improve independence, health and wellbeing, capture interest and positive engagement, facilitate social interaction and decrease impact of many different medical conditions affecting older people.",,,,,"Carneiro, João/ABA-9293-2020; Corchado Rodríguez, Juan/D-3229-2013; Marreiros, Goreti/AGP-2538-2022","Carneiro, João/0000-0003-1430-5465; Corchado Rodríguez, Juan/0000-0002-2829-1829; Marreiros, Goreti/0000-0003-4417-8401; Martinho, Diogo/0000-0003-1683-4950",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,OCT,2020.0,53.0,7,,,,,4863.0,4901,,10.1007/s10462-020-09809-6,0.0,,FEB 2020,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000515788900001,0

When arriving at a purchasing decision, a majority of online consumers rely on reviews since they offer credible means of mining opinions of other consumers regarding a particular product. The trustworthiness of online reviews directly affects a company's reputation and profitability, which is why certain business owners pay fraudsters to generate deceptive reviews. Such generation of deceptive reviews which manipulate the purchasing decision of consumers is a persistent and harmful issue. Hence, developing methods to assist businesses and consumers by distinguishing between credible reviews and deceptive reviews remains to be a crucial, yet challenging task. In view of that, this paper unravels prominent techniques that have been proposed to solve the issue of deceptive review detection.

In this environment, users hope to get a variety of customized services by using only an individual mobile device. But the resource of the mobile device has limitations such as tiny display screens, limited input, less powerful processors, and limited storage. Moreover each user situation is different and user preferences are also various. Therefore it is one of new issues to provide a customized service for a user through resource collaboration based on various user preference and situation. To solve this issue, this paper proposes a resource collaboration system which infers customized resources for composing a user required service and collaborative with selected resources. For our collaboration system, this paper proposes the method to infer resources based on the context and user preferences including dynamic change of the preference.

Therefore, effectively dealing with noise is a key aspect in supervised learning to obtain reliable models from data. Although several authors have studied the effect of noise for some particular learners, comparisons of its effect among different learners are lacking. In this paper, we address this issue by systematically comparing how different degrees of noise affect four supervised learners that belong to different paradigms. Specifically, we consider the Na < ve Bayes probabilistic classifier, the C4.5 decision tree, the IBk instance-based learner and the SMO support vector machine. We have selected four methods which enable us to contrast different learning paradigms, and which are considered to be four of the top ten algorithms in data mining (Yu et al. 2007). We test them on a collection of data sets that are perturbed with noise in the input attributes and noise in the output class. As an initial hypothesis, we assign the techniques to two groups, NB with C4.5 and IBk with SMO, based on their proposed sensitivity to noise, the first group being the least sensitive. The analysis enables us to extract key observations about the effect of different types and degrees of noise on these learning techniques. In general, we find that Na < ve Bayes appears as the most robust algorithm, and SMO the least, relative to the other two techniques. However, we find that the underlying empirical behavior of the techniques is more complex, and varies depending on the noise type and the specific data set being processed. In general, noise in the training data set is found to give the most difficulty to the learners.",,,,,"Herrera, Albert Fornells/D-2813-2014; Nettleton, David F/F-1073-2013","Herrera, Albert Fornells/0000-0003-4214-5227; Nettleton, David F/0000-0002-5852-7716",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,APR,2010.0,33.0,4,,,,,275.0,306,,10.1007/s10462-010-9156-z,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000275459500001,0

Examples, to mention a few, include the industrial trend toward agent-based supply chain management, the business trend toward virtual enterprises, and the pivotal role that electronic commerce is increasingly assuming in many organizations. Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers have paid a great deal of attention to automated negotiation over the past decade and a number of prominent models have been proposed in the literature. These models exhibit fairly different features, make use of a diverse range of concepts, and show performance characteristics that vary significantly depending on the negotiation context. As a consequence, assessing and relating individual research contributions is a difficult task. Currently, there is a need to build a framework to define and characterize the essential features that are necessary to conduct automated negotiation and to compare the usage of key concepts in different publications. Furthermore, the development of such a framework can be an important step to identify the core elements of autonomous negotiating agents, to provide a coherent set of concepts related to automated negotiation, to assess progress in the field, and to highlight new research directions. Accordingly, this paper introduces a generic framework for automated negotiation. It describes, in detail, the components of the framework, assesses the sophistication of the majority of work in the AI literature on these components, and discusses a number of prominent models of negotiation.

Ramsey, Stich & Garson (1991) have argued that it does, but their argument depends on a particular construal of the ontology of beliefs, according to which beliefs are discrete inner causal entities. In this paper I situate their argument within the broader issues of the clash of scientific and manifest images of the world, and the ontological mind-body problem. Their way of understanding belief places them in a long tradition of philosophers who conceive of mind and cognition as the same thing, a tradition that includes people as diverse as Descartes, Fodor, Churchland, and virtually all current cognitive scientists and cognitive neuroscientists. An alternative perspective on the nature of belief was championed by Ryle and is currently exemplified by Dennett's neo-instrumentalism. I argue that PDP-style connectionism, rather than implying that there are no beliefs, implies that the construal of the ontology of belief within the mind-as-cognition framework is mistaken. Beliefs are not discrete inner causal entities. Mind is not ontologically homogeneous; rather, like an economy, it is made up of a diversity of entities of very different ontological kinds interrelated in complex ways.

Processing tasks at the network edge can effectively solve the problems of personal privacy leakage and server overloading. As a result, it has attracted a great deal of attention. A number of efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) models are proposed to do so. However, since they require much computing and memory resources, none of them can be deployed to such typical edge computing devices as Raspberry Pi 3B+ and 4B+ to meet the real-time requirements of user tasks. Considering that a traditional machine learning method can precisely locate an object with a highly acceptable calculation load, this work reviews state-of-the-art literature and then proposes a CNN with reduced input size for an object detection system that can be deployed in edge computing devices. It splits an object detection task into object positioning and classification. In particular, this work proposes a CNN model with 44 x 44-pixel inputs instead of much more inputs, e.g., 224 x 224-pixel in many existing methods, for edge computing devices with slow memory access and limited computing resources. Its overall performance has been verified via a facial expression detection system realized in Raspberry Pi 3B+ and 4B+.

One of these methods is the Grey Wolf Optimiser (GWO), which resembles the grey wolf's leadership hierarchy and its hunting behavior in nature. The GWO adopts the hierarchical nature of grey wolfs and lists the best solution as alpha, followed by beta and delta in descending order. Additionally, its hunting technique of tracking, encircling and attacking are also modeled mathematically to find the best optimised solution.

Semantic association computation is a key component of various applications belonging to a multitude of fields, such as computational linguistics, cognitive psychology, information retrieval and artificial intelligence. The field of semantic association computation has been studied for decades. The aim of this paper is to present a comprehensive survey of various approaches for computing semantic associations, categorized according to their underlying sources of background knowledge. Existing surveys on semantic computation have focused on a specific aspect of semantic associations, such as utilizing distributional semantics in association computation or types of spatial models of semantic associations. However, this paper has put a multitude of computational aspects and factors in one picture. This makes the article worth reading for those researchers who want to start off in the field of semantic associations computation. This paper introduces the fundamental elements of the association computation process, evaluation methodologies and pervasiveness of semantic measures in a variety of fields, relying on natural language semantics. Along the way, there is a detailed discussion on the main categories of background knowledge sources, classified as formal and informal knowledge sources, and the underlying design models, such as spatial, combinatorial and network models, that are used in the association computation process. The paper classifies existing approaches of semantic association computation into two broad categories, based on their utilization of background knowledge sources:knowledge-richapproaches; andknowledge-leanapproaches. Each category is divided further into sub-categories, according to the type of underlying knowledge sources and design models of semantic association.

The extension of grounding phenomenon for abstract words is very important for social interactions of cognitive robots in real scenarios. This paper reviews the strength of symbolic and connectionist methods to address the abstract word grounding problem in cognitive robots. In particular, the presented work is focused on designing and simulating cognitive robotics model to achieve a grounding mechanism for abstract words by using the semantic network approach, as well as examining the utility of connectionist computation for the same problem. Two neuro-robotics models based on feed forward neural network and recurrent neural network are presented to see the pros and cons of connectionist approach. The simulation results and review of attributes of these methods reveal that the proposed symbolic model offers the solution to the problem of grounding abstract words with attributes like high data storage capacity with recall accuracy, structural integrity and temporal sequence handling. Whereas, connectionist computation based solutions give more natural solution to this problem with some shortcomings that include combinatorial ambiguity, low storage capacity and structural rigidity. The presented results are not only important for the advancement in communication system of cognitive robot, also provide evidence for embodied nature of abstract language.",,,,,"Rasheed, Nadia/AAF-1858-2019; Bhatti, Abdul Rauf/P-8244-2017","Bhatti, Abdul Rauf/0000-0001-9609-4563; Asghar, Mamoona/0000-0001-7460-266X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,OCT,2018.0,50.0,3,,,,,467.0,494,,10.1007/s10462-017-9608-9,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000444373100004,0

Then, the correctness of choosing the patient in the best and worst condition is also examined among randomly selected pairs. As a result of the experimental study, rankings obtained by the COMET method are distinctly more accurate than those obtained by TOPSIS or AHP techniques.

In this tutorial paper, we will look at neural networks from a dynamical systems point of view and examine its properties. To this purpose, we collect results regarding chaos theory as well as the backpropagation algorithm and establish a relationship between them. We study in detail as an example the learning of the exclusive OR, an elementary Boolean function. The following conclusions hold for our XOR neural network: no chaos appears for learning rates lower than 5, when chaos occurs, it disappears as learning progresses. For non-chaotic learning rates, the network learns faster than for other learning rates for which chaos occurs.",,,,,"Bertels, Koen/ABG-3443-2020",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,,,,,MAY,2001.0,15.0,3,,,,,165.0,187,,10.1023/A:1011045100817,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000168847600002,0

The principal feature of the representation is that it linearises multidimensional space, while still providing for the description of individual objects within that space and the relationships that may exist between those objects (in any direction and through any number of dimensions). In addition the representation is supported by an arithmetic which allows the manipulation (translation etc.) of spatial objects. Consequently, when incorporated into a spatial reasoning system, all necessary processing can be implemented as if in only one dimension. This offers two significant advantages over more conventional multi-directional approaches to spatial reasoning. Firstly, many of the concerns associated with the exponential increase in the number or relations that need to be considered (as the number of dimensions under consideration increases) are no longer relevant. Secondly, the computational cost of manipulating and comparing spatial objects remains static at its one dimensional level, regardless of the number of dimensions under consideration.",,,,,,"Bench-Capon, Trevor/0000-0003-3975-4398",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,,,,,AUG,1998.0,12.0,4,,,,,321.0,343,,10.1023/A:1006541105578,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000074827200002,0

The rapid mapping of plankton abundance together with taxonomic and size composition is very important for ocean environmental research, but difficult or impossible to accomplish using traditional techniques. In this paper, we present a new pattern recognition system to classify large numbers of plankton images detected in real time by the Video Plankton Recorder (VPR), a towed underwater video microscope system. The difficulty of such classification is compounded because: 1) underwater images are typically very noisy, 2) many plankton objects are in partial occlusion, 3) the objects are deformable and 4) images are projection variant, i.e., the images are video records of three-dimensional objects in arbitrary positions and orientations. Our approach combines traditional invariant moment features and Fourier boundary descriptors with gray-scale morphological granulometries to form a feature vector capturing both shape and texture information of plankton images. With an improved learning vector quantization network classifier, we achieve 95% classification accuracy on six plankton taxa taken from nearly 2,000 images. This result is comparable with what a trained biologist can achieve by using conventional manual techniques, making possible for the first time a fully automated, at sea-approach to real-time mapping of plankton populations.",,,,,"Rohlf, F J/A-8710-2008; Tang, Xiaoou/G-6509-2012",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,,,,,FEB,1998.0,12.0,1-3,,,,,177.0,199,,10.1023/A:1006517211724,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000074581300010,0

Until fairly recently however, comparatively little attention has been given to the issues which underly good grammar formalism design in computational linguistics. This paper examines a number of fundamental issues in the design of formalisms for representing grammatical knowledge.

Accurate prediction of stock prices plays a decisive role in constructing the investment decision or risk hedging. However, accurate prediction of the stock price is a thorny task, because stock price fluctuations are non-linear and chaotic. In order to promote the accuracy of stock price prediction, a multi-factor two-stage deep learning integrated prediction system based on intelligent optimization and feature clustering is proposed to predict stock price in this paper. Firstly, a multi-factor analysis is carried out to select a variety of factors that have an impact on the stock price, and adopt the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm to eliminate factors with low correlation. The second step is to apply the idea of classification prediction to cluster the filtered feature set. Further, multiple parameters of long short-term memory (LSTM) are optimized by genetic algorithm (GA), and multiple GA-LSTM models are obtained by training each clustering result. Finally, the results of each class predicted by the GA-LSTM model are nonlinearly integrated to acquire the final prediction model, which is applied to the prediction of the test set. The experimental results indicate that the performance of the proposed model outperforms other baseline models in China's two stock markets and the New York stock exchange. At the same time, these results fully prove that the prediction model proposed by us possesses more reliable and better predictive ability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s10462-022-10352-9,0.0,,DEC 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000896508300001,0

Any abnormality in the shape of anatomical regions of the brain needs to be detected as early as possible to reduce the mortality rate. It is also beneficial for treatment planning and therapy. The most crucial task is to isolate abnormal areas from normal tissue regions. To identify abnormalities in the earlier stage, various medical imaging modalities were used by medical practitioners as part of the diagnosis. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive diagnostic tool used for analyzing the internal structures owing to its capability to provide images with high resolution and better contrast for soft tissues. This survey focuses on studies done in brain MRI. Manual segmentation of abnormal tissues is a time-consuming task, and the performance depends on the expert's efficiency. Hence automating tumor segmentation plays a vital role in medical imaging applications. This study aims to provide a comprehensive survey on recent works developed in brain tumor segmentation. In this paper, a systematic literature review is presented to the reader to understand three policies, namely classical scheme, machine learning strategy, and deep learning methodology meant for tumor segmentation. Our primary goal is to include classical methods like atlas-based strategy and statistical-based models employed for segmenting tumors from brain MRI. Few studies that utilized machine learning approaches for the segmentation and classification of brain structures are also discussed. After that, the study provides an overview of deep learning-based segmentation models for quantitative analysis of brain MRI. Deep learning plays a vital role in the automatic segmentation of brain tissues. Presently deep learning technique outshines traditional statistical methods and machine learning approaches. An effort is made to enclose the literature on patch-based and semantic-based tissue segmentation presented by researchers working in the discipline of medical imaging. The manuscript discusses the basic convolutional neural network architecture, Data Sets, and the existing deep learning techniques for tissue segmentation coupled with classification.

The objective of this article is to compare those distance measures in a support vector machine setting. A support vector machine is a state-of-the-art classifier for static (non-time series) datasets and usually outperforms k-Nearest Neighbour, however it is often noted that that 1-NN DTW is a robust baseline for time-series classification. Through a collection of experiments we determine that the most effective distance measure is Dynamic Time Warping and the most effective classifier is kNN. However, a surprising result is that the pairing of kNN and DTW is not the most effective model. Instead we have discovered via experimentation that Dynamic Time Warping paired with the Gaussian Support Vector Machine is the most accurate time series classifier. Finally, with good reason we recommend a slightly inferior (in terms of accuracy) model Time Warp Edit Distance paired with the Gaussian Support Vector Machine as it has a better theoretical basis. We also discuss the reduction in computational cost achieved by using a Support Vector Machine, finding that the Negative Kernel paired with the Dynamic Time Warping distance produces the greatest reduction in computational cost.",,,,,,"Cunningham, Padraig/0000-0002-3499-0810",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,MAR,2022.0,55.0,3,,,,,1803.0,1820,,10.1007/s10462-021-10050-y,0.0,,JUL 2021,,,,,,35370341.0,,,,,WOS:000677942700001,0

A brief background of AI, and specifically machine learning (ML) algorithms, is provided including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). We categorize creative applications into five groups, related to how AI technologies are used: (i) content creation, (ii) information analysis, (iii) content enhancement and post production workflows, (iv) information extraction and enhancement, and (v) data compression. We critically examine the successes and limitations of this rapidly advancing technology in each of these areas. We further differentiate between the use of AI as a creative tool and its potential as a creator in its own right. We foresee that, in the near future, ML-based AI will be adopted widely as a tool or collaborative assistant for creativity. In contrast, we observe that the successes of ML in domains with fewer constraints, where AI is the 'creator', remain modest. The potential of AI (or its developers) to win awards for its original creations in competition with human creatives is also limited, based on contemporary technologies. We therefore conclude that, in the context of creative industries, maximum benefit from AI will be derived where its focus is human-centric-where it is designed to augment, rather than replace, human creativity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,JAN,2022.0,55.0,1,,,,,589.0,656,,10.1007/s10462-021-10039-7,0.0,,JUL 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000668818400001,0

However, the using of SNNs on practical scenarios is rather limited, as a result of the lack of high efficient learning algorithms. Nowadays, learning methods of SNNs are designed mainly based on previous biological discoveries. The fact that there are both excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons in the biological neural network has stimulated the motive of this research. The existence of inhibitory neurons could strengthen the self-regulation ability of neural networks and improve learning efficiency. Inspired by the ancient Chinese Yin and Yang Theory, we first presented our effort at constructing SNN structure with equilibrated excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons.

CA distributed representation in recurrent architecture outperforms the local representation in recurrent architecture (stack reservoir), then echo state networks and feed-forward architecture using local or distributed representation. Extracted features from the reservoir, using the natural diffusion of CA states in the reservoir offers the state-of-the-art results in terms of feature vector length and the required training examples. Another extension is obtained by combining the reservoir CA states using XOR, Binary or Gray operator to produce a single feature vector to reduce the feature space.

It is too difficult, time consuming and expensive to translate everything from scratch in each language. Machine translation offers a solution, as it provides translation automatically. Until recently, statistical machine translation has proved to be one of the most successful approaches. However, a new approach to machine translation based on neural networks has emerged with promising results. The present paper concerns phrase-based statistical machine translation, an area that has been extensively studied in the literature. The translation system consists of many components built on the premise of probabilities. Each component is described separately. Although high quality translation systems have been developed for certain language pairs, there is still a large number of languages that cause many translation errors. Languages with a rich morphology pose an especially difficult challenge for research. We address one group of morphologically rich languages: Slavic languages, which constitute a relatively homogeneous family of languages characterized by rich, inflectional morphology. The present paper offers a comprehensive survey of approaches to coping with Slavic languages in different aspects of statistical machine translation. We observe that the interest of the community in research of more difficult languages is increasing and we believe that the translation quality of those languages will reach the level of practical use in the near future.",,,,,"Brest, Janez/B-8013-2008","Brest, Janez/0000-0001-5864-3533",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,JAN,2019.0,51.0,1,,,,,77.0,117,,10.1007/s10462-017-9558-2,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000456521600005,0

Sensitivity analysis methods aim at evaluating the influence of each variable of a problem on a model (i.e. objective function) response. Such methods provide knowledge on the function behavior and would be suitable for guiding metaheuristics. To evaluate correctly the dimensions influences, usual sensitivity analysis methods need a lot of evaluations of the objective function or are constrained with an experimental design. In this paper, we propose a new method, with a low computational cost, which can be used into metaheuristics to improve their search process. This method is based on two global sensitivity analysis methods: the linear correlation coefficient technique and Morris' method. We propose to transform the global study of a non linear model into a local study of quasi-linear sub-parts of the model, in order to evaluate the global influence of each input variable on the model. This sensitivity analysis method will use evaluations of the objective function done by the metaheuristic to compute a weight of each variable. Then, the metaheuristic will generate new solutions choosing dimensions to offset, according to these weights. The tests done on usual benchmark functions of sensitivity analysis and continuous optimization (CEC 2013) reveal two issues. Firstly, our sensitivity analysis method provides good results, it correctly ranks each dimension's influence. Secondly, integrating a sensitivity analysis method into a metaheuristic (here, Differential Evolution and ABC with modification rate) improves its results.",,,,,,"Chelouah, Rachid/0000-0002-7473-2680; Loubiere, Peio/0000-0003-1522-5694",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,DEC,2018.0,50.0,4,,,,,625.0,647,,10.1007/s10462-017-9553-7,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000450509000005,0

Odia is a classical and popular language in the Indian subcontinent used by more than 50 million people. In spite of its rich history, popularity and usefulness, not much research efforts have been made to achieve human level accuracy in case of Odia OCR.

Hence, there is growing interest among the research community for developing new approaches to automatically summarize the text. Automatic text summarization system generates a summary, i.e. short length text that includes all the important information of the document. Since the advent of text summarization in 1950s, researchers have been trying to improve techniques for generating summaries so that machine generated summary matches with the human made summary. Summary can be generated through extractive as well as abstractive methods. Abstractive methods are highly complex as they need extensive natural language processing. Therefore, research community is focusing more on extractive summaries, trying to achieve more coherent and meaningful summaries. During a decade, several extractive approaches have been developed for automatic summary generation that implements a number of machine learning and optimization techniques. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent text summarization extractive approaches developed in the last decade. Their needs are identified and their advantages and disadvantages are listed in a comparative manner. A few abstractive and multilingual text summarization approaches are also covered. Summary evaluation is another challenging issue in this research field. Therefore, intrinsic as well as extrinsic both the methods of summary evaluation are described in detail along with text summarization evaluation conferences and workshops. Furthermore, evaluation results of extractive summarization approaches are presented on some shared DUC datasets.

Following the approach proposed by the recent literature on agent environments those open distributed systems can be efficiently and effectively modeled as a set of correlated physical and institutional spaces of interaction where objects and agents are situated. In our view in distributed open systems, spaces are fundamental for modeling the fact that events, actions, and social concepts (like norms and institutional objects) should be perceivable only by the agents situated in the spaces where they happen or where they are situated. Institutional spaces are also crucial for their active functional role of keeping track of the state of the interaction, and for monitoring and enforcing norms. Given that in an open distributed and dynamic system it is fundamental to be able to create and destroy spaces of interaction at run-time, in this paper we propose to create them using Artificial Institutions (AIs) specified at design time. This dynamic creation is a complex task that deserves to be studied in all details. For doing that, in this paper, we will first define the various components of AIs and spaces using Semantic Web Technologies, then we will describe the mechanisms for using AIs specification for realizing spaces of interaction.

We compare its performance with an alternative system that uses Naive Bayes. We find that there is little to choose between the two alternatives in cross-validation tests on data sets.

J,"Hamedi, M",,,,"Hamedi, M",,,Intelligent fixture design through a hybrid system of artificial neural network and genetic algorithm,ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW,,,,,,,,,,,,"In designing fixtures for machining operations, clamping scheme is a complex and highly nonlinear problem that entails the frictional contact between the workpiece and the clamps. Such parameters as contact area, state of contact, clamping force, wear and damage in the contact area and deformation of the component are of special interest. A viable fixture plan must include the optimum values of clamping forces. Along research efforts carried out in this area, this comprehensive problem in fixture design needs further investigation. In this study, a hybrid learning system that uses nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA) with a supportive combination of artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic algorithm (GA) is discussed. A frictional model of workpart-fixture system under cutting and clamping forces is solved through FEA. Training and querying an ANN takes advantage of the results of FEA. The ANN is required to recognize a pattern between the clamping forces and state of contact in the workpiece-fixture system and the workpiece maximum elastic deformation. Using the identified pattern, a GA-based program determines the optimum values for clamping forces that do not cause excessive deformation/stress in the component. The advantage of this work against similar studies is manifestation of exact state of contact between clamp elements and workpart. The results contribute to automation of fixture design task and computer aided process planning (CAPP).",,,,,"Hamedi, Mohsen/U-7721-2018","Hamedi, Mohsen/0000-0001-5794-430X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,,,,,MAY,2005.0,23.0,3,,,,,295.0,311,,10.1007/s10462-004-7187-z,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000227965600003,0

These tasks not only require knowledge about specific unix-related plans but also abstract knowledge about how beliefs can be justified. This paper shows how this knowledge can be represented and sketches how it can be used to form justifications for advisor beliefs and to understand justifications given for user beliefs. Knowledge about belief justification is captured by justification patterns, domain-independent knowledge structures that are similar to the abstract knowledge structures used to understand the point behind a story.

COVID-19 came as a nightmare and it is still not over yet, changing its form factor with each mutation. Moreover, each unpredictable mutation causes more severeness. In the present article, we outline a decision support algorithm using Generalized Trapezoidal Intuitionistic Fuzzy Numbers (GTrIFNs) to deal with various facets of COVID-19 problems. Intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) and their continuous counterparts, viz., the intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IFNs), have the flexibility and effectiveness to handle the uncertainty and fuzziness associated with real-world problems. Although a meticulous amount of research works can be found in the literature, a wide majority of them are based mainly on normalized IFNs rather than the more generalized approach, and most of them had several limitations. Therefore, we have made a sincere attempt to devise a novel Similarity Measure (SM) which considers the evaluation of two prominent features of GTrIFNs, which are their expected values and variances. Then, to establish the superiority of our approach we present a comparative analysis of our method with several other established similarity methods considering ten different profiles of GTrIFNs. The proposed SM is then validated for feasibility and applicability, by elaborating a Fuzzy Multicriteria Group Decision Making (FMCGDM) algorithm and it is supportedby a suitable illustrative example. Finally, the proposed SM approach is applied to tackle some significant concerns due to COVID-19. For instance, problems like the selection of best medicine for COVID-19 infected patients; proper healthcare waste disposal technique; and topmost government intervention measures to prevent the COVID-19 spread, are some of the burning issues which are handled with our newly proposed SM approach.

The combination of these two problems creates a new and difficult scenario for classification tasks and has been discussed in several research works over the past two decades. In this paper, we argue that despite some insightful information can be derived from related research, the joint-effect of class overlap and imbalance is still not fully understood, and advocate for the need to move towards a unified view of the class overlap problem in imbalanced domains. To that end, we start by performing a thorough analysis of existing literature on the joint-effect of class imbalance and overlap, elaborating on important details left undiscussed on the original papers, namely the impact of data domains with different characteristics and the behaviour of classifiers with distinct learning biases. This leads to the hypothesis that class overlap comprises multiple representations, which are important to accurately measure and analyse in order to provide a full characterisation of the problem. Accordingly, we devise two novel taxonomies, one for class overlap measures and the other for class overlap-based approaches, both resonating with the distinct representations of class overlap identified. This paper therefore presents a global and unique view on the joint-effect of class imbalance and overlap, from precursor work to recent developments in the field. It meticulously discusses some concepts taken as implicit in previous research, explores new perspectives in light of the limitations found, and presents new ideas that will hopefully inspire researchers to move towards a unified view on the problem and the development of suitable strategies for imbalanced and overlapped domains.",,,,,"Wilk, Szymon/K-1685-2014; Soares, Carlos/J-5764-2012","Wilk, Szymon/0000-0002-7807-454X; Seoane Santos, Miriam/0000-0002-5912-963X; Soares, Carlos/0000-0003-4549-8917",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,DEC,2022.0,55.0,8,,,,,6207.0,6275,,10.1007/s10462-022-10150-3,0.0,,MAR 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000780287700001,0

Each member of the collective of autonomous vehicles tries to adapt to the changing environment, therefore together they execute decentralised autonomous adaptation by exploiting real-time information about their environment. The routing of these vehicles needs proper computer science models to be able to develop the best information technology for their control. We review different traffic flow models in computer science, and we evaluate their usefulness and applicability to autonomous vehicles. The classical game theory model implies flow level decision making in route selection. Non-cooperative autonomous vehicles may produce unwanted traffic patterns. Improved decentralised autonomous adaptation techniques try to establish some kind of coordination among autonomous vehicles, mainly through intention awareness. The aggregation of the intentions of autonomous vehicles may help to predict future traffic situations. The novel intention-aware online routing game model points out that intention-awareness helps to avoid that the traffic generated by autonomous vehicles be worse than the traffic indicated by classical traffic flow models.

The irregularities in the pace of heartbeats, called cardiac arrhythmias or heart arrhythmias, are one of the commonly diagnosed CVDs caused by ischemic heart disease, hypertension, alcohol intake, and stressful lifestyle. Other than the listed CVDs, the abnormality in the cardiac rhythm caused by the long term mental stress (stimulated by Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)) is a challenging issue for researchers. Early detection of cardiac arrhythmias through automatic electronic techniques is an important research field since the invention of electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) and advanced machine learning algorithms. ECG (EKG) provides the record of variations in electrical activity associated with the cardiac cycle, used by cardiologists and researchers as a gold standard to study the heart function. The present work is aimed to provide an extensive survey of work done by researchers in the area of automated ECG analysis and classification of regular & irregular classes of heartbeats by conventional and modern artificial intelligence (AI) methods. The artificial intelligence (AI) based methods have emerged popularly during the last decade for the automatic and early diagnosis of clinical symptoms of arrhythmias. In this work, the literature is explored for the last two decades to review the performance of AI and other computer-based techniques to analyze the ECG signals for the prediction of cardiac (heart rhythm) disorders. The existing ECG feature extraction techniques and machine learning (ML) methods used for ECG signal analysis and classification are compared using the performance metrics like specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, positive predictivity value, etc. Some popular AI methods, which include, artificial neural networks (ANN), Fuzzy logic systems, and other machine learning algorithms (support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), etc.) are considered in this review work for the applications of cardiac arrhythmia classification. The popular ECG databases available publicly to evaluate the classification accuracy of the classifier are also mentioned. The aim is to provide the reader, the prerequisites, the methods used in the last two decades, and the systematic approach, all at one place to further purse a research work in the area of cardiovascular abnormalities detection using the ECG signal.

Sources from various domains generate a near-limitless volume of data in temporal order. Such data are referred to as data streams, and are generally nonstationary as the characteristics of data evolves over time. This phenomenon is called concept drift, and is an issue of great importance in the literature, since it makes models obsolete by decreasing their predictive performance. In the presence of concept drift, it is necessary to adapt to change in data to build more robust and effective classifiers. Drift detectors are designed to run jointly with classification models, updating them when a significant change in data distribution is observed. In this paper, we present an implicit (unsupervised) algorithm called One-Class Drift Detector (OCDD), which uses a one-class learner with a sliding window to detect concept drift. We perform a comprehensive evaluation on mostly recent 17 prevalent concept drift detection methods and an adaptive classifier using 13 datasets.

The local attributes of an image such as shape, color, and texture are not sufficient for effective CBIR. Visual similarity is a principal step in CBIR and in the baseline approach. In this article, we introduce a novel approach, which relies on the fusion of visual words of scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) and binary robust invariant scalable keypoints (BRISK) descriptors based on the visual-bag-of-words approach. The two local feature descriptors are chosen as their fusion adds complementary improvement to CBIR. The SIFT descriptor is capable of detecting objects robustly under cluttering due to its invariance to scale, rotation, noise, and illumination variance. However, SIFT descriptor does not perform well at low illumination or poorly localized keypoints within an image. Due to this reason, the discriminative power of the SIFT descriptor is lost during the quantization process, which also reduces the performance of CBIR. However, the BRISK descriptor provides scale and rotation-invariant scale-space, high quality and adaptive performance in classification based applications. It also performs better at poorly localized keypoints along the edges of an object within an image as compared to the SIFT descriptor. The suggested approach based on the fusion of visual words achieves effective results on the Corel-1K, Corel-1.5K, Corel-5K, and Caltech-256 image repositories as equated to the feature fusion of both descriptors and latest CBIR approaches with the surplus assistances of scalability and fast indexing.",,,,,"Mehmood, Dr. Zahid/S-1709-2018; Saba, Tanzila/D-4593-2018; Mahmood, Toqeer/O-1681-2013; Javid, Muhammad Arshad/AAK-3639-2021","Mehmood, Dr. Zahid/0000-0003-4888-2594; Saba, Tanzila/0000-0003-3138-3801; Mahmood, Toqeer/0000-0003-3125-2430; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,AUG,2019.0,52.0,2,,,,,901.0,925,,10.1007/s10462-018-9636-0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000472573300005,0

Transformation methods enable the use of two different feature selection approaches: local, where the selection is performed independently for each of the transformed problems, and global, where the selection is performed on the original dataset, meaning that all local classifiers work on the same set of features.

Using the fact that the ARMG covers all of the examples and that it is a subset of the variabilization of one of the examples, we identify literals that cannot appear in the ARMG and remove them prior to computing the generalisation. We apply this procedure to the ProGolem ILP system and test its performance on several real world data sets.

Most often, power system optimization problems have non-linear and non-convex objective functions with intense equality and inequality constraints along with various types of decision variables (continuous, discrete and integer). As modern electrical power systems become more complex, planning, operation and control of such systems using traditional methods face increasing difficulties. Owing to the ability of escaping local optima, meta-heuristic optimization algorithms can be efficient alternatives to solve power system optimization problems. Inspired by the improvisation process of music, harmony search (HS) algorithm is a meta-heuristic search method which has received a considerable attention to solve different power system optimization problems. HS has simple concept, is easy to implement, converges rapidly to the solution and has high efficiency.

Therefore, incremental learning is of more and more importance in real world data mining scenarios. Decision trees, due to their characteristics, have been widely used for incremental learning. In this paper, we propose a novel incremental decision tree algorithm based on rough set theory. To improve the computation efficiency of our algorithm, when a new instance arrives, according to the given decision tree adaptation strategies, the algorithm will only modify some existing leaf node in the currently active decision tree or add a new leaf node to the tree, which can avoid the high time complexity of the traditional incremental methods for rebuilding decision trees too many times. Moreover, the rough set based attribute reduction method is used to filter out the redundant attributes from the original set of attributes. And we adopt the two basic notions of rough sets: significance of attributes and dependency of attributes, as the heuristic information for the selection of splitting attributes. Finally, we apply the proposed algorithm to intrusion detection.

Script recognition techniques are classified into three categories: firstly, segmentation-free methods or holistic approaches, that compare a sequence of observations derived from whole word image with similar references of words in the small lexicon. Secondly, segmentation-based methods, that look for the best match between consecutive sequences of primitive segments and letters of a possible word similar to human-like reading technique, in which secure features found all over the word are used to boot-strap a few candidates for a final evaluation phase; thirdly, hybrid approaches.

They involve the positioning of a set of small arbitrarily-shaped pieces on a large stretch of material, without overlapping them. The problem constraints are bidimensional in nature and have to be imposed on each pair of pieces. This all-to-all pattern results in a quadratic number of constraints. Constraint programming has been proven applicable to this category of problems, particularly in what concerns exploring them to optimality. But it is not easy to get effective propagation of the bidimensional constraints represented via finite-domain variables. It is also not easy to achieve incrementality in the search for an improved solution: an available bound on the solution is not effective until very late in the positioning process. In the sequel of work on positioning non-convex polygonal pieces using a CLP model, this work is aimed at improving the expressiveness of constraints for this kind of problems and the effectiveness of their resolution using global constraints. A global constraint outside for the non-overlapping constraints at the core of nesting problems has been developed using the constraint programming interface provided by Sicstus Prolog. The global constraint has been applied together with a specialized backtracking mechanism to the resolution of instances of the problem where optimization by Integer Programming techniques is not considered viable.

In particular, the interaction between visual attention and linguistic reference. In parallel with this, several theories of discourse have attempted to provide an account of the relationship between types of referential expressions on the one hand and the degree of mental activation on the other. Building on both of these traditions, this paper describes an attention based approach to visually situated reference resolution. The framework uses the relationship between referential form and preferred mode of interpretation as a basis for a weighted integration of linguistic and visual attention scores for each entity in the multimodal context. The resulting integrated attention scores are then used to rank the candidate referents during the resolution process, with the candidate scoring the highest selected as the referent. One advantage of this approach is that the resolution process occurs within the full multimodal context, in so far as the referent is selected from a full list of the objects in the multimodal context. As a result situations where the intended target of the reference is erroneously excluded, due to an individual assumption within the resolution process, are avoided.

Two multiple-valued algebras are described, one based on level detection, and the other on literal functions. Then a decision table which had also been reduced in size using rough set theory, is now reduced using both algebras and it is seen that all three approaches lead to reductions of comparable simplicity. The new methods require coding the values of each attribute as integers. Then an MVL function that maps the coding of the condition attributes to the coding of the decision attribute is found. As the coded table is sparse only some of the basis functions for each algebra are required. Then a simple approach requiring the reduction of a matrix to row echelon form is used to finding all suitable MVL functions. By decomposing a function in terms of its variables a complete set of rules can be found. The MVL function encodes the data in a very compact form and its decomposition into subfunctions reveals a good way to slice up the table into subtables. The structure of the subfunctions can then be used to simplify each subtable until compact sets of rules emerge. Alternatively, rules can be found by substitution into the MVL function. Encoding a decision table using MVL makes the data easy to manipulate and can uncover relationships that may not become apparent when using other methods.",,,,,,"Maguire, Liam/0000-0001-6153-3298",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,APR,2003.0,19.0,2,,,,,153.0,176,,10.1023/A:1022617312306,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000181393500002,0

In order for the classifiers to be effective intrusion detection models, we need to have sufficient audit data for training and also select a set of predictive system features. We propose to use the association rules and frequent episodes computed from audit data as the basis for guiding the audit data gathering and feature selection processes. We modify these two basic algorithms to use axis attribute(s) and reference attribute(s) as forms of item constraints to compute only the relevant patterns.

Thus, the team members should investigate, in depth, any information relating to the development. A major challenge for developers is software development effort estimation (SDEE), which refers to gauging the amount of effort needed to develop the software. In agile methodologies, a project is delivered in iterations, each of which delivers a set of requirements known as user stories. Therefore, SDEE in agile focuses on estimating a single user story's effort, not the project as a whole, as in traditional development. Among the various techniques, data-driven methods have proved effective in effort estimation, as they are unaffected by external pressure from managers. Moreover, no experts have to be available at the point when estimation is undertaken. By conducting a systematic literature review, this study presents a comprehensive overview of data-driven techniques for user story effort estimation. The results show that there has been limited work on this topic. Studies were analysed to address questions covering five main points: technique; performance evaluation method; accuracy, independent factors (effort drivers); and the characteristics of the datasets. The main performance evaluation methods are performance measures, baseline benchmarks, statistical tests, distribution of estimates, comparison against similar existing techniques and human estimation. Four types of independent factors were identified: personnel; product; process; and estimation.

Memristor, which is an emerging electron device with the capability of data storage and processing information simultaneously, can be employed to construct a bioinspired neuromorphic computing system. Simulation as one of the most powerful methods to obtain the optimizing result for the memristor-based neuromorphic network has been extensively focused to realize the high precision calculation. It becomes very difficult because the pulse-to-pulse (P2P) model is limited by the updating process. The memristor-based multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) network online training generally presents a low accuracy. Therefore, an efficiency training schedual is urgently desired to improve the accuracy. Based on the resistive switching behavior observed in the Ag/TiOx/F-doped SnO2 memristor, the weight update by the P2P model enables the MLP network online training in the low accuracy memristor with high performance. The low bits MLP optimized by a novel weight update schedual can realize high precision identification and classification. By that, the time and power consumption of memristor can be largely reduced. The experiment result illustrates that the high accuracy of 90.82% and 95.44% can be obtained at the first and final epoch of the MNIST handwritten digital datasets, respectively. Importantly, the number of the weight update, and the online training time and power consumption can be reduced by 81% and 93.7%, respectively.

Currently, DL is one of the best methods of extracting knowledge from large sets of raw data in a (nearly) self-organized manner. The technical design of DL depends on the feed-forward information flow principle of artificial neural networks with multiple layers of hidden neurons, which form deep neural networks (DNNs). DNNs have various architectures and parameters and are often developed for specific applications. However, the training process of DNNs can be prolonged based on the application and training set size (Gong et al. 2015). Moreover, finding the most accurate and efficient architecture of a deep learning system in a reasonable time is a potential difficulty associated with this approach. Swarm intelligence (SI) and evolutionary computing (EC) techniques represent simulation-driven non-convex optimization frameworks with few assumptions based on objective functions. These methods are flexible and have been proven effective in many applications; therefore, they can be used to improve DL by optimizing the applied learning models. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the most recent approaches involving the hybridization of SI and EC algorithms for DL, the architecture of DNNs, and DNN training to improve the classification accuracy. The paper reviews the significant roles of SI and EC in optimizing the hyper-parameters and architectures of a DL system in context to large scale data analytics.

So, inspiring from the evaluation of partitions, researchers turn to define measures for evaluation of clusters. Many stability measures have been proposed such as Normalized Mutual Information to validate a partition. The defined measures are based on Normalized Mutual Information. The drawback of the commonly used approach will be discussed in this paper and a criterion is proposed to assess the association between a cluster and a partition which is called Edited Normalized Mutual Information, ENMI criterion. The ENMI criterion compensates the drawback of the common Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) measure. Also, a clustering ensemble method that is based on aggregating a subset of primary clusters is proposed. The proposed method uses the Average ENMI as fitness measure to select a number of clusters. The clusters that satisfy a predefined threshold of the mentioned measure are selected to participate in the final ensemble. To combine the chosen clusters a set of consensus function methods are employed. One class of the used consensus functions is the co-association based consensus functions. Since the Evidence Accumulation Clustering, EAC, method can't derive the co-association matrix from a subset of clusters, Extended EAC, EEAC, is employed to construct the co-association matrix from the chosen subset of clusters. The second class of the used consensus functions is based on hyper graph partitioning algorithms. The other class of the used consensus functions considers the chosen clusters as a new feature space and uses a simple clustering algorithm to extract the consensus partitioning.

Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers are widely used in a variety of applications including automatic generation control (AGC), automatic voltage regulators, power system stabilizers and flexible AC transmission system devices. Automatic generation control plays an important role in power system operation to maintain the frequency within an acceptable range and to properly respond to load changes under normal conditions. Using the PIDs, AGC keeps the balance between generation and load demand in order to minimize frequency deviations. Furthermore, the AGC regulates the tie-line power exchange and facilitates bilateral contracts spanning over several control areas, thus ensuring reliable operation of the interconnected transmission system. Since the power system load variations occur continually, generation control is set to automatic to restore the frequency after disturbances. The PID controllers have the advantage of simple structure, good stability, and high reliability. However, a robust and efficient tuning of PID parameters are still being investigated using different techniques. One of the recent areas of such studies is nature-inspired algorithms. The main objective of utilizing nature-inspired algorithms is to optimize parameters of several controllers simultaneously.

The hybrid decision forest with these base classifiers are trained in nine different sized resampled training sets. We have examined the performance of all these ensembles from different point of views; we have studied the bias-variance decomposition of the misclassification error of the ensembles, then we have investigated the amount of dependence and degree of uncertainty among the base classifiers of these ensembles using information theoretic measures. The experiment was designed to find out: (1) optimal training set size for each base classifier and (2) which base classifier is optimal for this kind of decision forest. In the final comparison, we have checked whether the subsampled version of the decision forest outperform the bootstrapped version. All the experiments have been conducted with 20 benchmark datasets from UCI machine learning repository.

We conducted a series of experiments applying three learning approaches - lazy Q-learning, k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and a genetic algorithm - to a particular differential game called a pursuit game. Our experiments demonstrate that Ic-NN had great difficulty solving the problem, while a lazy version of Q-learning performed moderately well and the genetic algorithm performed even better. These results motivated the next step in the experiments, where we hypothesized Ic-NN was having difficulty because it did not have good examples - a common source of difficulty for lazy learning.

With regard to the detection of the causal influences and the identification of graphical causal networks, the developed tools have better performances than those reported in the literature. For example, the TDNN ensembles can cope with evolving systems, non-Markovianity, feedback loops and multicausality.

It becomes more crucial when interdisciplinary, collaborative and other uncertain papers are published by an author or institute only to receive the ranking. In this case precise characterization of founding author or institute of given domain generate uncertainty. This problem starts because document publications, collaboration or expert analysis of given field is totally dark data set which contains lots of unstructured, incomplete or uncertain data. Due to which, less attention has been paid towards this direction. However, it impacts more to recruitment process analysis, brain drain analysis, reviewer comment analysis, collaborative publication analysis, loyal or honest author analysis, or even conflict of interest analysis. To control this issue, a method is proposed in this paper to characterize the the document published by any institute or author in true, false or indeterminant zone of given domain using the properties of single-valued neutrosophic set. The expert of the given domain is classified based on defined (alpha, beta, gamma)-cut.

Therefore, in order to present a better approach to the uncertainty problems encountered, Q-neutrosophic soft sets (Abu Qamar in Entropy 20:172, 2018), which are a generalization of neutrosophic soft sets, are proposed for processing two-dimensional uncertain information. Moreover, relations are one of the methods preferred by researchers to explain the correspondences between objects in uncertain environments. The purpose of this paper is to explain the correspondence between objects in a better way. For this, the Q-neutrosophic soft set theory defined in Abu Qamar and Hassan (Entropy 20:172,2018) has been modified by taking inspiration from the definition of neutrosophic soft sets proposed by Deli and Broumi (J Intell Fuzzy Syst 28:2233-2241, 2015). In this way, it has been ensured that the two-dimensional information can be used more effectively in uncertainty problems encountered in many real-life problems. In this paper, Q-neutrosophic soft relations are defined by referring to the modified Q-neutrosophic soft set theory and analyzed in detail. Later, concepts related to Q-neutrosophic soft relations such as composition, inverse, functions, equivalence classes, and partitions are given. These concepts are especially exemplified by selecting uncertainty problems that can be encountered in real life and some related properties and theorems are presented.

Machine Learning (ML) tools have proved to be very performing in this task, in the sense that they can achieve very high success rates. However, both realism and interpretability of their models are low, leading to modest increases of knowledge and limited applicability, particularly in applications related to nonlinear and complex systems. In this paper, a methodology is described, which, by applying ML tools directly to the data, allows formulating new scientific models that describe the actual physics determining the boundary between the classes. The proposed technique consists of a stack of different ML tools, each one applied to a specific subtask of the scientific analysis; all together they form a system, which combines all the major strands of machine learning, from rule based classifiers and Bayesian statistics to genetic programming and symbolic manipulation. To take into account the error bars of the measurements generating the data, an essential aspect of scientific inference, the novel concept of the Geodesic Distance on Gaussian manifolds is adopted. The properties of the methodology have been investigated with a series of systematic numerical tests for different types of classification problems. The potential of the approach to handle real data has been tested with various experimental databases, built using measurements collected in the investigations of complex systems.

This work attempts to investigate the abilities of various existing techniques when applied for short term, high granular time series forecasting of PM2.5. More specifically, a comparative study has been provided, taking into account both popularly used models and lesser-used models in this area. The study has been carried out considering ten well defined models that are ARIMA (auto-regressive integrated moving average), SARIMA (seasonal ARIMA), SES (single exponential smoothing), DES (double exponential smoothing), TES (triple exponential smoothing), ANN (artificial neural network), DT (decision tree), kNN (k-nearest neighbor), LSTM (long short-term memory) and MCFO (markov chain first order). A framework has been built that categories the models, implements them under identical execution environment and forecasts succeeding values. Implementation has been carried out over five data sets of real-world air pollution time series, that are collected from five differently located government setup monitoring stations over a period of 1 year (July 2018-June 2019). Rigorous statistical analysis has been performed that yields an insight to the nature and variability of these time series data. Forecasting has been carried out on short term basis, focusing on high granularity whereas, three different lengths of forecast horizon (1 day, 1 week, and 1 month) have been tested. Eventually, the models have been compared in terms of their associated performance measuring units namely, RMSE (root mean of squared error), MAE (mean absolute error) and MAPE (mean absolute percentage error). The comparative results verified with multiple datasets show that all the models posses less error for a shorter forecast horizon, where LSTM providing the best performance. Superiority of machine learning and deep learning models are found in case of longer length of forecast horizon with kNN achieving best accuracy whereas, significant performance degradation of ARIMA is found for longer forecast horizon. Moreover, TES, DT, kNN, LSTM, MCFO are found to be well adopted in relation with shape and variability of the data. Note that the performance on various length of high granular forecast horizon have been studied over multiple datasets that give an added value to this work.",,,,,"MIDDYA, ASIF IQBAL/AAU-4012-2020; Roy, Sarbani/J-1997-2018","MIDDYA, ASIF IQBAL/0000-0001-6558-4930; Roy, Sarbani/0000-0002-7598-8266",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,FEB,2022.0,55.0,2,,,,,1253.0,1287,,10.1007/s10462-021-09991-1,0.0,,MAR 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000634623900001,0

Inspired by the Euclidean approach for ranking IFVs, we present a novel order that can overcome the aforementioned shortcomings using the notion of relative geometric distance. With the help of graphic representation of an IFV, we analyze the existing popular approaches for ranking IFVs and point out their drawbacks. Taking into account these three distances between an IFV and the ideal negative point, ideal positive point and most uncertain point, respectively, we present a relative-distance-based mensuration for describing the favorable degree of the IFV. Accordingly, the boundaries used in the existing ranking approaches for IFVs are replaced by a novel curve. We prove that the proposed method satisfies the admissibility, robustness, and determinacy requirements. Finally, we extend the presented ranking method for IFVs by introducing human attitudes and compare the proposed approach with the existing ones, which indicates its availability and rationality.

In simple terms, this is the problem that helps to solve what the expression referring to a referent refers to. It is considered to be one of the tedious tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP). AR's burgeoning popularity among researchers is attributable to its strong relevance to machine translation, text summarization, chatbot, question answering, and many others. This paper presents a review of AR approaches based on significant features utilized to perform this task and presents the evaluation metrics for this field. The feature is a relevant term related to AR that provides vital information regarding anaphor, antecedent, and relation between them. In this context, features represent the lexical, syntactical, semantical, and positional relationship between anaphor and its possible candidate antecedent. The performance of the Anaphora resolution system is profoundly dependent on the features used in the AR system. Hence, the selection of features for the AR system is highly significant. The main emphasis is to provide an overview of the various features needed to extract both the Anaphora and the Antecedent, respectively, used in different AR systems, present in literature. It is observed that syntactical information enhances the correctness of determining the properties for the existence of an anaphor and antecedent identification. Nowadays the trend is changing from hand-crafted feature dependent methods to deep learning approaches which try to learn feature representation. The performance of deep learning is progressing due to the accessibility of additional data and more powerful computing resources.

Moreover, in some cases, feature subset selection can improve the classification performance. Feature selection and instance selection can be interesting since the choice of features and instances greatly influence the performance of the learnt models as well as their training costs. In the past, unifying both problems was carried out by solving a global optimization problem using meta-heuristics. This paradigm not only does not exploit the manifold structure of data but can be computationally expensive. To the best of our knowledge, the joint use of sparse modeling representative and feature subset relevance have not been exploited by the joint feature and selection methods. In this paper, we target the joint feature and instance selection by adopting feature subset relevance and sparse modeling representative selection. More precisely, we propose three schemes for the joint feature and instance selection. The first is a wrapper technique while the two remaining ones are filter approaches. In the filter approaches, the search process adopts a genetic algorithm in which the evaluation is mainly given by a score that quantify the goodness of the features and instances. An efficient instance selection technique is used and integrated in the search process in order to adapt the instances to the candidate feature subset.

Although previous recommendation systems are effective in creating attired recommendations, however, they still suffer from different types of challenges such as accuracy, scalability, cold-start, and data sparsity. In the last few years, deep learning has attained substantial interest in various research areas such as computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Deep learning based approaches are vigorous in not only performance improvement but also to feature representations learning from the scratch. The impact of deep learning is also prevalent, recently validating its efficacy on information retrieval and recommender systems research. In this study, a comprehensive review of deep learning-based rating prediction approaches is provided to help out new researchers interested in the subject.

Such approaches either involve traditional machine learning techniques or deep learning practices to learn, extract and represent different preference knowledge such as review topics, review sentiments, linguistic aspects and feature words. With the huge number of users' review texts on products or services and as researchers propose new rating prediction methods which utilize different preference knowledge, it's necessary to review the methods, the acquired knowledge and how such methods make predictions. This study unveils comprehensive overview of the acquired preference knowledge and how the rating prediction approaches learn, represent and utilize such knowledge. Associated prediction methods were analyzed and presented along two perspectives: traditional machine learning; and deep learning practices. This paper not only evaluates the influence of the acquired preference knowledge in extending or regulating base methods but also identifies associated challenges in predicting ratings. Selected publications were analyzed to reveal different tactics which rating prediction approaches utilize to resolve data sparsity along with cold start problems. Finally, a discussion about possible future trends is presented. The study suggests that application of effective techniques for learning, representing and utilizing preference knowledge can improve prediction accuracy of the models.

The proposed method, called consensus function based on two level clustering (CFTLC), introduces a new consensus clustering where it makes a cluster clustering task through applying an average hierarchical clustering on a cluster-cluster similarity matrix obtained by an innovative similarity metric. By applying the average hierarchical clustering algorithm, a set of meta clusters has been attained. Considering each meta cluster as a consensus cluster in the consensus clustering output, it then assigns each data point to a meta cluster through defining an object-cluster similarity. Before doing anything, CFTLC converts the primary partitions into a binary cluster representation where the primary ensemble has been broken into a number of basic binary clusters (BC). CFTLC first combines the basic BCs with the maximum cluster-cluster similarity. This step is iterated as long as a predefined number of meta clusters are ready.

Moreover, the majority voting method is applied to produce ensemble classifier for missing data classification.

One of the most commonly used is the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution. Its original version is based on the information provided by the decision maker as exact numerical values. However, in some real-life situations, the decision maker may not be able to precisely express the value of the ratings of alternatives with respect to criteria or else he/she uses linguistic expressions. In such situations he/she may use other data formats, such as: interval numbers, fuzzy numbers, ordered fuzzy numbers, hesitant fuzzy sets, intuitionistic fuzzy sets and other. On the other hand, the increasing complexity of the decision problems analysed makes it less feasible to consider all the relevant aspects of the problems by a single decision maker. As a result, many real-life problems are discussed by a group of decision makers. The aim of this paper and its main contribution is to present a new approach for ranking of alternatives for group decision making using the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution method based on ordered fuzzy numbers. This is an alternative to methods that use different forms of averages for the aggregation of the individual matrices into a collective matrix. In the proposed approach aggregation is not needed and all individual decision information of decision makers is taken into account in determining the ranking of alternatives and the selecting the best one. The key stage of this method is the transformation of the decision matrices provided by the decision makers into matrices of alternatives. A matrix corresponding to an alternative is composed of its assessments with respect to all criteria, performed by all the decision makers.

The yield stress performance of RAFM steel was successfully predicted by the hybrid model, which combined simulated annealing with the support vector machine for the first time. The prediction process was as follows: first, we used the improved annealing algorithm to optimize the SVR model after training on a training dataset. Next, we established the yield stress prediction model of RAFM steel. By testing the model and conducting sensitivity analysis on the model, we can conclude that, compared with other similar models such as the ANN, linear regression, generalized regression neural network, and random forest, the predictive attribute variables cover all of the variables in the training set.

The new features of CQA (such as huge volume, sparse data and crowdsourcing) violate fundamental assumptions of traditional recommendation systems.

We classify the recent solutions into four different categories: matrix factorization based models (MF-based models), gradient boosting tree based models (GBT-based models), deep learning based models (DL-based models) and ranking based models (R-based models). We find that MF-based models outperform other categories of models in the crowdsourcing situation. Moreover, we use innovative diagrams to clarify several important concepts of ensemble learning, and find that ensemble models with several specific single models can further boost the performance.

The first of these types of deception involves sniping or late bidding, which not only allows an agent to conceal its true valuation for an item, but also potentially allows it to win an item for which it may not possess the highest valuation.

A much simpler learner can suffice in domains with narrow funnels; i.e. where most domain variables are controlled by a very small subset. Such a learner is TAR2: a weighted-class minimal contrast-set association rule learner that utilizes confidence-based pruning, but not support-based pruning. TAR2 learns treatments; i.e. constraints that can change an agent's environment. Treatments take two forms. Controller treatments hold the smallest number of conjunctions that most improve the current state of the system. Monitor treatments hold the smallest number of conjunctions that best detect future faulty system behavior. Such treatments tell an agent what to do (apply the controller) and what to watch for (the monitor conditions) within the current environment. Because TAR2 generates very small theories, our experience has been that users prefer its tiny treatments.

Noise can reduce system performance in terms of classification accuracy, time in building a classifier and the size of the classifier. Accordingly, most existing learning algorithms have integrated various approaches to enhance their learning abilities from noisy environments, but the existence of noise can still introduce serious negative impacts. A more reasonable solution might be to employ sonic preprocessing mechanisms to handle noisy instances before a learner is formed. Unfortunately, rare research has been conducted to systematically explore the impact of noise, especially from the noise handling point of view. This has made various noise processing techniques less significant, specifically when dealing with noise that is introduced in attributes. In this paper, we present a systematic evaluation on the effect of noise in machine learning. Instead of taking any unified theory of noise to evaluate the noise impacts, we differentiate noise into two categories: class noise and attribute noise, and analyze their impacts on the system performance separately. Because class noise has been widely addressed in existing research efforts, we concentrate on attribute noise. We investigate the relationship between attribute noise and classification accuracy, the impact of noise at different attributes, and possible solutions in handling attribute noise. Our conclusions can be used to guide interested readers to enhance data quality by designing various noise handling mechanisms.",,,,,"Wu, Xindong/AAB-6713-2022","Wu, Xindong/0000-0003-2396-1704",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,NOV,2004.0,22.0,3,,,,,177.0,210,,10.1007/s10462-004-0751-8,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000225767100001,0

Real world objects are divided into four categories: substance, event, attribute and others. The first three are named as noun, verb and adjective, respectively. The comprehension process of the named objects and the generation process of the named motion are shown along the five levels. Furthermore, vision and motion are connected and controlled by planning. Next, language is considered to ''describe any data or processing in mind'' in our model. From this are derived three functions: surveying any mental object, organizing high-level thought, and communicating with others. The realization of these functions is discussed from the point of generation. Next, an integrated system for vision, motion, and language is implemented on workstations. The system, or an intellectual and emotional agent, simulates the protagonist or fox of an Aesop fable.

First, two label count matrices are constructed from the original label matrix from the perspective of positive and negative labels independently. This is done through statistics on the k nearest neighbors according to the input features. Second, positive and negative label matrices are decomposed and recovered using matrix factorization, namely double k (k nearest neighbors and k latent semantics). Third, new features are generated according to the recovered matrices by label concept. Fourth, we exploit the independence of the labels to guide the training process.

These information explosions require extensive studies as well as more advanced methods in order to better understand and effectively model/learn these high-dimensional/structure-complicated textual datasets. Moving along with the recent progresses in deep learning and textual representation learning approaches, many researchers in this domain have been attracted by utilizing different deep neural architectures for learning essential features from texts. These novel neural architectures must enable to handle complex textual feature engineering. Moreover, it also has to be able to extract deeper semantic and structural information from textual resources. Recently, there are several integrations between advanced deep learning architectures, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) and transformers in text classification have been proposed. These hybrid deep neural architectures have shed light on how computers can comprehensively process sequential information from texts to fine-tune for leveraging the performance of multiple tasks in natural language processing, including classification. However, most of recent RNN-based techniques still suffer from several limitations. These limitations are mainly related to the capability of capturing the global long-range dependent as well syntactical structures of the given text corpus.

In order to bring more clarity to research findings, we propose the HIRE (Human, (Artificial) Intelligence, Recruitment, Evaluation) framework with the primary aim of evaluating studies which investigate how Artificial Intelligence can be integrated into the recruitment process with respect to gauging whether AI is an adequate, better, or worse substitute for human recruiters. We illustrate the simplicity of this framework by conducting a systematic literature review on the empirical studies assessing AI in the recruitment process, with 22 final papers included. The review shows that AI is equal to or better than human recruiters when it comes to efficiency and performance. We also find that AI is mostly better than humans in improving diversity. Finally, we demonstrate that there is a perception among candidates and recruiters that AI is worse than humans. Overall, we conclude based on the evidence, that AI is equal to or better to humans when utilised in the hiring process, however, humans hold a belief of their own superiority.

However, each study only compares with either under- or over-sampling methods to make the final conclusion. Therefore, the research objective of this paper is to find out which order of combining under- and over-sampling methods perform better.

The results show that if the under-sampling algorithm is chosen carefully, i.e. IB3, no significant performance improvement is obtained by further addition of the over-sampling step.

Hence, the process of identifying the proper meaning of a polysemous word with respect to the context is known as word sense disambiguation (WSD). For the extraction of actual meaning, WSD is an essential technique in Natural Language Processing. Over the last two decades, a lot of algorithms have been proposed to solve this linguistic ambiguity problem in various languages. In addition, a number of review papers have been published in various most spoken languages.

In order to make their storage and transfer efficient, different data compression techniques are used in the literature. The ultimate motive behind data compression is to transform a big size data into small size data, which eventually implies less space while archiving, and less time in transferring. However, in order to operate/analyze compressed data, it is usually necessary to decompress it, so as to bring back the data to its original form, which unfortunately warrants an additional computing cost. In this backdrop, if operating upon the compressed data itself can be made possible without going through the stage of decompression, then the advantage that could be accomplished due to compression would escalate. Further due to compression, from the data structure and storage perspectives, the original visibility structure of the data also being lost, it turns into a potential challenge to trace the original information in the compressed representation. This challenge is the motivation behind exploring the idea of direct processing on the compressed data itself in the literature. The proposed survey paper specifically focuses on compressed document images and brings out two original contributions. The first contribution is that it presents a critical study on different image analysis and image compression techniques, and highlights the motivational reasons for pursuing document image analysis in the compressed domain. The second contribution is that it summarizes the different compressed domain techniques in the literature so far based on the type of compression and operations performed by them.

A careful evaluation of a specific machine learning algorithm is important, but often difficult to conduct in practice. On the other hand, simulation studies can provide insights on behavior and performance aspects of machine learning approaches much more readily than using real-world datasets, where the target concept is normally unknown. Under decision tree induction algorithms an interesting source of instability that sometimes is neglected by researchers is the number of classes in the training set. This paper uses simulation to extended a previous work performed by Leo Breiman about properties of splitting criteria. Our simulation results have showed the number of best-splits grows according to the number of classes: exponentially, for both entropy and twoing criteria and linearly, for gini criterion. Since more splits imply more alternative choices, decreasing the number of classes in high dimensional datasets (ranging from hundreds to thousands of attributes, typically found in biomedical domains) can help lowering instability of decision trees. Another important contribution of this work concerns the fact that for 5 classes balanced datasets are prone to provide more best-splits (thus increasing instability) than imbalanced ones, including binary problems often addressable in machine learning; on the other hand, for five or more classes balanced datasets can provide few best-splits.",,,,,"Baranauskas, José Augusto/B-3573-2011","Baranauskas, José Augusto/0000-0002-7501-7187",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,FEB,2015.0,43.0,2,,,,,301.0,310,,10.1007/s10462-012-9374-7,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000348340000008,0

Mixed-type variables are quite common in practical problems, but this property has been taken into account only seldom in pattern recognition, data mining and decision making algorithms. We observed that these two distance measures are not actually metrics after having found a special situation when they are not metric, but pseudometric, a feature to be noted while using them. Nevertheless, by changing their definitions somewhat, it is possible to meet the metricity. Especially in medical applications, the redefinition of the two measures might be important, since otherwise it is possible in theory that, for example, two identical cases would be classified differently. Nearest neighbor searching tests with medical data were run to illustrate the behavior of these measures. Notwithstanding the violation of the metricity their original forms yielded slightly better classification results. The reason was that in real data sets tested there were very few almost similar cases according to these distance measures, and the original forms based on more separating distances than the redefinitions were slightly better in the classification.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,AUG,2007.0,28.0,2,,,,,163.0,178,,10.1007/s10462-009-9096-7,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000263915500003,0

The calculus of relation algebras is an equational formalism; it tells us which relations must exist, given several basic operations, such as Boolean operations on relations, relational composition and converse. Each equation in the calculus corresponds to a theorem, and, for a situation where there are only finitely many relations, one can construct a composition table which can serve as a look up table for the relations involved. Since the calculus handles relations, no knowledge about the concrete geometrical objects is necessary. In this sense, relational calculus is pointless. Relation algebras were introduced into temporal reasoning by Allen ( 1983, Communications of the ACM 26( 1), 832 - 843) and into spatial reasoning by Egenhofer and Sharma ( 1992, Fifth International Symposium on Spatial Data Handling, Charleston, SC). The calculus of relation algebras is also well suited to handle binary constraints as demonstrated e. g. by Ladkin and Maddux ( 1994, Journal of the ACM 41( 3), 435 - 469).

When objective replacement occurs, this strategy selects good chromosomes according to the new objective set from the solutions found before objective replacement, and then continues to optimize them via evolution for the new objective set.

In this paper, a palmprint fuzzy commitment (FC) is proposed based on DHC. A palmprint FC is proposed based on DHC. The DHC has high accuracy, small size, strong robustness, and is free from shift-matching for dislocation problems, so the proposed palmprint FC can satisfactorily balance the accuracy, storage cost and computational complexity. In addition, the DHCs of multi-spectral palmprints are concatenated and the bits are selected according to discrimination power analysis, so the accuracy is further improved.

Due to the lack of proper training, the medical practitioners may sometimes overlook some of the vital information either during the auscultation of the heart sound or visual inspection of the PCG signal. Therefore the need for an automated and accurate anomaly detection method based on PCG becomes urgent. The aim of this work is to design a reliable algorithm for the automatic detection of heart valve disorders (HVDs) without any segmentation of the heart sound signals. Teager-Kaiser energy operator (TKEO) and rational dilation wavelet transform (RDWT) are utilized to extract representative features in order to detect abnormal patterns in PCG signals with the employment of deep learning model. First, TKEO is used to extract the instantaneous energy of the source that generates the PCG signal rather than the energy of the signal itself. Then, RDWT is employed to decompose the instantaneous energy of the PCG signal into different sub-bands. The oscillatory characteristics of PCG has been retained in these sub-bands, which are served as discriminant features. Third, these features are fed to one-dimensional (1D) convolutional neural networks (CNN) for classification. Finally, experiments including two types of classification named binary classification (normal vs. abnormal) and multi-class classification (normal vs. aortic stenosis vs. mitral regurgitation vs. mitral stenosis vs. mitral valve prolapse), are carried out on a well-known and publicly available PCG database to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Despite the development and availability of different vaccines for COVID-19, scientists still warn the citizens of new severe waves of the virus, and as a result, fast diagnosis of COVID-19 is a critical issue. Chest imaging proved to be a powerful tool in the early detection of COVID-19. This study introduces an entire framework for the early detection and early prognosis of COVID-19 severity in the diagnosed patients using laboratory test results. It consists of two phases (1) Early Diagnostic Phase (EDP) and (2) Early Prognostic Phase (EPP). In EDP, COVID-19 patients are diagnosed using CT chest images. In the current study, 5, 159 COVID-19 and 10, 376 normal computed tomography (CT) images of Egyptians were used as a dataset to train 7 different convolutional neural networks using transfer learning. Data augmentation normal techniques and generative adversarial networks (GANs), CycleGAN and CCGAN, were used to increase the images in the dataset to avoid overfitting issues. 28 experiments were applied and multiple performance metrics were captured. Classification with no augmentation yielded 99.61% accuracy by EfficientNetB7 architecture.

A CNN is adapted and evaluated with a twofold purpose. First, to perform a rough localization step (room retrieval) by means of the output layer. Second, to refine this localization in the retrieved room (fine localization step) by means of holistic descriptors obtained from intermediate layers of the same CNN. The robot estimates its position within the selected room/s through a nearest neighbour search by comparing the obtained holistic descriptor with the visual model of the retrieved room/s. Additionally, this method takes advantage of the likelihood information provided by the output layer of the CNN. This likelihood is helpful to determine which rooms should be considered in the fine localization process.

With the advent of this technology, the cost of power computation, application hosting, content storage, resource wastage, and delivery is reduced significantly. Cloud computing provides the possibility of merely concentrating on business goals instead of expanding hardware resources for users. Challenging work in virtualization technology is the placement of virtual machines under optimal conditions on physical machines in cloud data centers. Optimal placement of virtual machines over physical ones in cloud data centers can lead to the management of resources and prevention of the resources waste. Hereby, a new approach is proposed based on the combination of the hybrid discrete multi-object whale optimization algorithm, multi-verse optimizer with chaotic functions for optimal placement in the cloud data center.

The second goal is to cut the resource wastage and managing resources using the optimal placement of virtual machines over physical machines in cloud data centers.

The VIKOR method is considered to be a useful MAGDM method, specifically in conditions where an expert is unable to determine his choice correctly at the initiation of designing a system. The method of VIKOR is suitable for problems containing conflicting attributes, with an assumption that compromising is admissible for conflict decision, the expert wishes a solution very near to the best, and the different alternatives or choices are processed according to all developed attributes. The theory of set pair analysis is a state-of-the-art uncertainty theory which consists of three factors, including identity degree, discrepancy degree, and contrary degree of connection numbers (CNs) and coincidence with many existing theories dealing with vagueness in the given information. Consequently, inspired by this, in the present study, we make an effort to improve the theory of data measurement by introducing some metric spaces using CNs of BFSs. In this research paper, we extend VIKOR method in the context of CNs based metrics, which are obtained form bipolar fuzzy numbers (BFNs). Firstly, we develop CNs of BFNs as well as metric spaces based on CNs. We also discuss some interesting properties of proposed metric spaces. Secondly, we develop VIKOR method using CNs based metrics to handle an MAGDM problem under bipolar fuzzy type information.

Applications of artificial intelligent algorithms in wind farm controllers, Mach number, wind speed prediction, wind power prediction and other problems of wind farms are reviewed. Two future research directions are pointed out to develop artificial intelligent algorithms for wind farm control systems and wind speed and power prediction.",,,,,"Yu, Yang/ABE-3449-2021; Wang, Yirui/AAI-4618-2020; GAO, Shangce/I-3422-2012","Wang, Yirui/0000-0001-5767-3343; GAO, Shangce/0000-0001-5042-3261",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,JUN,2020.0,53.0,5,,,,,3447.0,3500,,10.1007/s10462-019-09768-7,0.0,,OCT 2019,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000492349600001,0

An empirical evaluation on rule-based sentiment analysis,ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW,,,,,,,,,,,,"Syntactic parsing, the process of obtaining the internal structure of sentences in natural languages, is a crucial task for artificial intelligence applications that need to extract meaning from natural language text or speech. Sentiment analysis is one example of application for which parsing has recently proven useful. In recent years, there have been significant advances in the accuracy of parsing algorithms. In this article, we perform an empirical, task-oriented evaluation to determine how parsing accuracy influences the performance of a state-of-the-art rule-based sentiment analysis system that determines the polarity of sentences from their parse trees. In particular, we evaluate the system using four well-known dependency parsers, including both current models with state-of-the-art accuracy and more innacurate models which, however, require less computational resources. The experiments show that all of the parsers produce similarly good results in the sentiment analysis task, without their accuracy having any relevant influence on the results. Since parsing is currently a task with a relatively high computational cost that varies strongly between algorithms, this suggests that sentiment analysis researchers and users should prioritize speed over accuracy when choosing a parser; and parsing researchers should investigate models that improve speed further, even at some cost to accuracy.",,,,,"Gómez-Rodríguez, Carlos/A-5935-2011","Gómez-Rodríguez, Carlos/0000-0003-0752-8812; Alonso-Alonso, Iago/0000-0001-6550-2771",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,OCT,2019.0,52.0,3,,,,,2081.0,2097,,10.1007/s10462-017-9584-0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000486256400018,0

J,"Wallace, BC",,,,"Wallace, Byron C.",,,Computational irony: A survey and new perspectives,ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW,,,,,,,,,,,,"Irony is a fundamental rhetorical device. It is a uniquely human mode of communication, curious in that the speaker says something other than what he or she intends. Recently, computationally detecting irony has attracted attention from the natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) communities. While some progress has been made toward this end, I argue that current machine learning methods rely too heavily on shallow, unstructured, syntactic modeling of text to consistently discern ironic intent. Irony detection is an interesting machine learning problem because, in contrast to most text classification tasks, it requires a semantics that cannot be inferred directly from word counts over documents alone. To support this position, I survey the large body of existing philosophical/literary work investigating ironic communication. I then survey more recent computational efforts to operationalize irony detection in the fields of NLP and ML. I identify the disparities of the latter with respect to the former. Specifically, I highlight a major conceptual problem in all existing computational models of irony: none maintain an explicit model of the speaker/environment. I argue that without such an internal model of the speaker, irony detection is hopeless, as this model is necessary to represent expectations, which play a key role in ironic communication. I sketch possible means of embedding such models into computational approaches to irony detection. In particular, I introduce the pragmatic context model, which looks to operationalize computationally existing theories of irony.

In this paper, we present a fully automated method for annotating fluorescent confocal microscopy images in highly complex conditions.

The second layer is comprised of two probabilistic classifiers, responsible for determining how many components may constitute each segmented region. The first of these employs rule-based reasoning grounded on the decreasing harmonic pattern observed in the region area density function, while the second one consists of a Support Vector Machine trained with features derived from the log likelihood ratio function of Gaussian mixture models of each region.

This paper proposes a personalized defection detection and prevention procedure based on the observation that potential defectors have a tendency to take a couple of months or weeks to gradually change their behaviour (i.e., trim-out their usage volume) before their eventual withdrawal. For this purpose, we suggest a SOM (Self-Organizing Map) based procedure to determine the possible states of customer behaviour from past behaviour data. Based on this state representation, potential defectors are detected by comparing their monitored trajectories of behaviour states with frequent and confident trajectories of past defectors. Also, the proposed procedure is extended to prevent the defection of potential defectors by recommending the desirable behaviour state for the next period so as to lower the likelihood of defection. For the evaluation of the proposed procedure, a case study has been conducted for a Korean online game site.

We adopt a model-based approach that uses a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that has as states the stages of the underlying process that generates the gene sequences, thus allowing us to handle complex and heterogeneous data. Each cluster is described in terms of a HMM where we seek to find schema mappings between the states of the original sequences and the states of the HMM. The general solution that we propose involves several distinct tasks. Firstly, there is a clustering problem where we seek to group similar sequences; for this we use mutual entropy to identify associations between sequence states. Secondly, because we are concerned with clustering heterogeneous sequences, we must determine the mappings between the states of each sequence in a cluster and the states of an underlying hidden process; for this we compute the most probable mapping. Thirdly, using these mappings we employ maximum likelihood techniques to learn the probabilistic description of the hidden Markov process for each cluster. Fourthly, we use these descriptions to characterise the clusters using Dynamic Programming to determine the most probable pathway for each cluster. Finally, we derive linguistic labels to describe the clusters in a user-friendly manner. Such an approach provides an intuitive way of describing the underlying shape of the process by explicitly modelling the temporal aspects of the data. Non time-homogeneous HMMs are used to capture the full temporal semantics.",,,,,,"McClean, Sally/0000-0002-6871-3504",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,,,,,OCT,2003.0,20.0,1-2,,,,,53.0,73,,10.1023/A:1026036631075,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000185826400004,0

It does not assume the existence of a teacher that provides examples upon which learning of a task takes place. Instead, in RL experience is the only teacher. With historical roots on the study of biological conditioned reflexes, RL attracts the interest of Engineers and Computer Scientists because of its theoretical relevance and potential applications in fields as diverse as Operational Research and Intelligent Robotics. Computationally, RL is intended to operate in a learning environment composed by two subjects: the learner and a dynamic process. At successive time steps, the learner makes an observation of the process state, selects an action and applies it back to the process. Its goal is to find out an action policy that controls the behavior of the dynamic process, guided by signals (reinforcements) that indicate how badly or well it has been performing the required task. These signals are usually associated to a dramatic condition - e.g., accomplishment of a subtask (reward) or complete failure (punishment), and the learner tries to optimize its behavior by using a performance measure (a function of the received reinforcements). The crucial point is that in order to do that, the learner must evaluate the conditions (associations between observed states and chosen actions) that led to rewards or punishments. Starting from basic concepts, this tutorial presents the many flavors of RL algorithms, develops the corresponding mathematical tools, assess their practical limitations and discusses alternatives that have been proposed for applying RL to realistic tasks.",,,,,"Ribeiro, Carlos/E-2641-2013","Ribeiro, Carlos/0000-0002-5760-8426",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,,,,,MAY,2002.0,17.0,3,,,,,223.0,250,,10.1023/A:1015008417172,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000174840700002,0

Many such agents minimize inter-agent communication by relying on changes in the environment as their cue for action. Some early successes of this model, especially in robotics (reactive agents), have led to a debate over this class of models as a whole. One of the issues on which attention has been drawn is that of conflicts between such agents. In this work we investigate a cyclic conflict that results in infinite looping between agents and has a severe debilitating effect on performance. We present some new results in the debate, and compare this problem with similar cyclicity observed in planning systems, meta-level planners, distributed agent models and hybrid reactive models. The main results of this work are: (a) The likelihood of such cycles developing increases as the behavior sets become more useful. (b) Control methods for avoiding cycles such as prioritization are unreliable, and (c) Behavior refinement methods that reliably avoid these conflicts (either by refining the stimulus, or by weakening the action) lead to weaker functionality.

A short summary is given on how aboutness is defined in more prominent information retrieval models. A model-theoretic definition of aboutness is then analyzed in an abstract setting using so called information fields. These allows properties of aboutness to be expressed independent of any given information retrieval model. As a consequence, information retrieval models can be theoretically compared according to what aboutness postulates they support. The Boolean and Coordinate retrieval models are compared in this fashion. In addition to model-theoretic aboutness, preferential entailment and conditional probabilities are employed to define aboutness between primitive information carriers. The preferential entailment approach is based on a preference semantics derived from nonmonotonic logics. The nonmonotonic behaviour of aboutness under information composition is highlighted. Rules describing how aboutness may be preserved under composition are proposed. Finally, a term aboutness definition drawn from a network-based probabilistic framework is analyzed.

Such models are claimed to have advantages over generative, rule-based approaches in terms of not just conceptual appropriateness but also computational efficiency. The claim with regard to the former is that, whilst generative approaches to morphology may well be useful for inflectionally simple natural languages such as English (where most of the processing is carried out at the sentence level, with dictionaries and lexicons being accessed to identify secondary inflectional information once primitive words are found), this approach is not at all suitable for inflectionally rich languages where grammatical information is carried not by the combination or pattern of distinct and separate words which make up the sentence but by the combination or pattern of inflections within a 'word' where, for instance, there are no clear boundaries between morphological constituents. The claim with regard to the latter is that many generative approaches to natural language are inefficient and, in some cases, computationally intractable, because of the heavy memory and processing demand placed on implementing actual models based on these approaches for anything more than a constrained fragment of a language. This paper describes an application of finite-state automata for Arabic noun inflections which leads to abstractions based on network topology as well as the form and content of network arcs. The idea of specific automata for specific inflection types inheriting some or all of the nodes, arc form and arc content of abstract automata representing more abstract classes of inflection is also introduced. This can lead to novel linguistic generalities and applications, as well as advantages in terms of procedural efficiency and representation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,,,,,,1993.0,7.0,6,,,,,373.0,399,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1993NN68200001,0

In general, the selection of the hyperparameters is a non-convex optimization problem and thus many algorithms have been proposed to solve it, among them: grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, simulated annealing, particle swarm optimization, Nelder Mead, and others. There have also been proposals to decouple the selection of gamma and C. We empirically compare 18 of these proposed search algorithms (with different parameterizations for a total of 47 combinations) on 115 real-life binary data sets. We find (among other things) that trees of Parzen estimators and particle swarm optimization select better hyperparameters with only a slight increase in computation time with respect to a grid search with the same number of evaluations. We also find that spending too much computational effort searching the hyperparameters will not likely result in better performance for future data and that there are no significant differences among the different procedures to select the best set of hyperparameters when more than one is found by the search algorithms.",,,,,,"Fonseca, Pablo/0000-0002-0208-2842; Wainer, Jacques/0000-0001-5201-1244",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,AUG,2021.0,54.0,6,,,,,4771.0,4797,,10.1007/s10462-021-10011-5,0.0,,MAY 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000655040600002,0

When people participate in the process of massive data processing, they will encounter data with different structures, so data has heterogeneity. How to acquire hidden and valuable knowledge from heterogeneous data and measure its uncertainty is an important problem in artificial intelligence. This paper investigates uncertainty measurement for heterogeneous data and gives its application in attribute reduction. The concept of a heterogeneous information system (HIS) is first proposed. Then, an equivalence relation on the object set is constructed. Next, uncertainty measurement for a HIS is investigated, a numerical experiment is given, and dispersion analysis, correlation analysis, and Friedman test and Bonferroni-Dunn test in statistics are conducted.

It integrated with suggested advanced DE (aDE) and PSO (aPSO). Where in aDE a novel mutation strategy and crossover probability along with the slightly changed selection scheme are introduced, to avoid premature convergence. And aPSO consists of the novel gradually varying inertia weight and acceleration coefficient parameters, to escape stagnation. So, convergence characteristic of aDE and aPSO provides different approximation to the solution space. Thus, haDEPSO achieve better solutions due to integrating merits of aDE and aPSO. Also in haDEPSO individual population is merged with other in a pre-defined manner, to balance between global and local search capability. The algorithms efficiency is verified through 23 basic, 30 CEC 2014 and 30 CEC 2017 test suite and comparing the results with various state-of-the-art algorithms.

This study aims to gain insights into SLS methods for solving the Partial Max-SAT (PMSAT) problem. The PMSAT is an NP-Hard problem, an optimization variant of the Propositional Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem, that has importance in theory and practice. Many real-world problems including timetabling, scheduling, planning, routing, and software debugging can be reduced to the PMSAT problem. Modern PMSAT solvers are able to solve practical instances with hundreds of thousands to millions of variables and clauses. However, performance of PMSAT solvers are still limited for solving some benchmark instances. In this paper, we present, investigate, and analyze state-of-the-art SLS methods for solving the PMSAT problem. An experimental evaluation is presented based on the MAX-SAT evaluations from 2014 to 2019. The results of this evaluation study show that the currently best performing SLS methods for the PMSAT problem fall into three categories: distinction-based, configuration checking-based, and dynamic local search methods. Very good performance was reported for the dynamic local search based method.

Not only are the dimensional problems that face the big data, but there are also other emerging problems such as redundancy, irrelevance, or noise of the features. Therefore, feature selection (FS) has become an urgent need to search for the optimal subset of features. This paper presents a hybrid version of the Harris Hawks Optimization algorithm based on Bitwise operations and Simulated Annealing (HHOBSA) to solve the FS problem for classification purposes using wrapper methods. Two bitwise operations (AND bitwise operation and OR bitwise operation) can randomly transfer the most informative features from the best solution to the others in the populations to raise their qualities. The Simulate Annealing (SA) boosts the performance of the HHOBSA algorithm and helps to flee from the local optima. A standard wrapper method K-nearest neighbors with Euclidean distance metric works as an evaluator for the new solutions. A comparison between HHOBSA and other state-of-the-art algorithms is presented based on 24 standard datasets and 19 artificial datasets and their dimension sizes can reach up to thousands. The artificial datasets help to study the effects of different dimensions of data, noise ratios, and the size of samples on the FS process.

Unfortunately, existing approaches put little emphasis on providing concepts and mechanisms that are generic enough to deal with a variety of disturbances while maintaining traffic fluidity. Moreover, only a few works have investigated case-based reasoning (CBR) to control traffic at signalized intersections. Existing works usually state that the case-base is created using experts' knowledge but do not specify how this knowledge is acquired and how the case-base is built. The contribution of this study is threefold. First, a new TSCS is designed to monitor and control traffic at a signalized intersection using innovative concepts and mechanisms borrowed from the biological immune memory and secondary immune response. Immune memory provides the concepts to represent cases to deal with disturbances in a more generic way, and immune secondary response mechanisms guide the design of a CBR system to monitor traffic and control disturbances. Second, a new learning algorithm for the creation of the case-base combining simulation-optimisation, condensed nearest neighbour algorithm and a rule-based system are developed. Third, the performance of the suggested TSCS is assessed by benchmarking it against two standard control strategies from the literature, namely fixed-time traffic signal control and the longest queue first-maximal weight matching algorithm. The suggested TSCS is implemented in Python and applied on an intersection simulated using VISSIM, a state-of-the-art traffic simulation software.

In the last few years, deep learning, the state-of-the-art machine learning technique utilized in many complex tasks, has been employed in recommender systems to improve the quality of recommendations. In this study, we provide a comprehensive review of deep learning-based recommendation approaches to enlighten and guide newbie researchers interested in the subject. We analyze compiled studies within four dimensions which are deep learning models utilized in recommender systems, remedies for the challenges of recommender systems, awareness and prevalence over recommendation domains, and the purposive properties.

However, due to the large amount of data flowing over the network, effective real time intrusion detection is almost impossible. The goal of this paper is to design a Hybrid IDS (HIDS) that can be successfully employed in a real time manner and suitable for resolving the multi-class classification problem. HIDS relies on a Naive Base feature selection (NBFS) technique, which is used to reduce the dimensionality of sample data. Moreover, HIDS has another pioneering issue that other techniques do not have, which is the outlier rejection. Outliers are noisy input samples that can lead to high rate of misclassification if they are applied for model training. Rejecting outliers has been accomplished through applying a distance based methodology to choose the most informative training examples, which are then used to train an Optimized Support Vector Machines (OSVM). Afterward, OSVM is employed for rejecting outliers. Finally, after outlier rejection, HIDS can successfully detect attacks through applying a Prioritized K-Nearest Neighbors (PKNN) classifier. Hence, HIDS is a triple edged strategy as it has three main contributions, which are: (i) NBFS, which has been employed for dimensionality reduction, (ii) OSVM, which is applied for outlier rejection, and (iii) PKNN, which is used for detecting input attacks. HIDS has been compared against recent techniques using three well-known intrusion detection datasets: KDD Cup '99, NSL-KDD and Kyoto 2006+ datasets. HIDS has the ability to quickly detect attacks and accordingly can be employed for real time intrusion detection. Thanks to OSVM and PKNN, HIDS performed high detection rates specifically for the attacks which are rare such as R2L and U2R. PKNN is also suitable for resolving the multi-label classification problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,MAR,2019.0,51.0,3,,,,,403.0,443,,10.1007/s10462-017-9567-1,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000463036600004,0

The Vietnamese adjectives often bear emotion which values (or semantic scores) are not fixed and are changed when they appear in different contexts of these phrases. Therefore, if the Vietnamese adjectives bring sentiment and their semantic values (or their sentiment scores) are not changed in any context, then the results of the emotion classification are not high accuracy.

The process still relied on the detailed description of offenders and their individual features with the purpose of merging the individual features together in order to create a final portrait. Extensive psychological research, and inclusion of its results into the facial composite procedure has led to the development of holistic systems which enable much more efficient identification of individuals utilising facial composites.

Existing methods for identifying the community structure are generally based on statistical-type properties, such as the degree of centrality, the shortest path betweenness centrality, the modularity, and so forth. However, the form of the community structure may vary widely, even if the number of vertices and edges are fixed. Consequently, it is difficult to be certain of the exact number of clusters within the network. Clustering schemes which require the number of clusters to be specified in advance often misjudge the community structure and yield a poor clustering performance as a result. Accordingly, the present study proposes a clustering algorithm, designated as the Weighted-Spectral Clustering Algorithm, capable of detecting the community structure of a network with no prior knowledge of the cluster number. The proposed method is tested on both computer-generated networks and several real-world networks for which the community structures are already known. The results confirm the ability of the proposed algorithm to partition the network into an appropriate number of clusters in every case.",,,,,"Lin, Hui-Tang/AAE-6097-2019","Lin, Hui-Tang/0000-0002-3183-5727",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,APR,2017.0,47.0,4,,,,,463.0,483,,10.1007/s10462-016-9488-4,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000397506200002,0

Within the MMC, models of social influence and social learning are used and integrated in a social network, which is composed of a set of individuals with links between them and involves a set of interaction rules. In this paper, a comparative study on the performance of the MMC with different network structures is proposed. Sixteen benchmark nonlinear optimization problems are solved, taking into account nine social topologies, which are: (a) linear, (b) tree, (c) star, (d) ring, (e) platoons, (f) von Neumann, (g) full connection, (h) random and (i) small world. In addition, the update of each topology structure was tested according to four different strategies: one static, two dynamic and one self-adaptive states. An exhaustive statistical analysis of the obtained numerical results indicates that the social dynamics has no significant impact on the MMC's behavior. However, the topology structures can be classified into groups that consistently influence the performance level of the MMC. More precisely, a structure characterized by a low value of its mean number of neighbors and a rather fast information transfer process (star topology) performs in a radically opposite way as structures where each agent has many neighbors (random and complete topologies).

However, at present there is not a clear consensus on classification criteria and performances. Second, with the evolution of the microelectronic technology and the design tools and techniques, new artificial neural networks (ANNs) implementations have been proposed, but they are not taken into consideration in the existing classification approaches of ANN hardware. In this paper, we propose a new approach for classification of neural networks hardware.

In the second part, we propose a new classification approach that takes into account most of consensual elements in one hand and in the other hand it takes into consideration the evolution of the design technology of integrated circuits and the design techniques. In the third part, we review examples of neural hardware achievements from industrial, academic and research institutions.

With automated code roaming the network intruding the users on one side as worms, viruses, and Trojans and autonomous agents tending to help the users on the other side, the internet has given great research challenges to the computer scientists. The greatest challenge of the internet is intrusion, which has increased and never decreased. There are various security systems for the internet.

Thus the internet security systems are comparable with human immune systems in which autonomous cells move throughout the body to protect it while learning to tackle new threats and keeping them in their memory for the future. These properties are comparable with that of autonomous agents in the internet.

Game theoretic models for bargaining assume that players are perfectly rational and that this rationality is common knowledge. However, the perfect rationality assumption does not hold for real-life bargaining scenarios with humans as players, since results from experimental economics show that humans find their way to the best strategy through trial and error, and not typically by means of rational deliberation. Such players are said to be boundedly rational. In playing a game against an opponent with bounded rationality, the most effective strategy of a player is not the equilibrium strategy but the one that is the best reply to the opponent's strategy. The evolutionary model provides a means for studying the bargaining behaviour of boundedly rational players. This paper provides a comprehensive comparison of the game theoretic and evolutionary approaches to bargaining by examining their assumptions, goals, and limitations.

The human and smart home appliances interaction may be based on input devices such as a mouse, keyboard, microphone, or webcam. The interaction between humans and machines can be established via speech using a microphone as one of the input modes. The Speech-based human and machine interaction is a more natural way of communication in comparison to other types of interfaces. Existing speech-based interfaces in the smart home domain suffer from some problems such as limiting the users to use a fixed set of pre-defined commands, not supporting indirect commands, requiring a large training set, or depending on some specific speakers. To solve these challenges, we proposed several approaches in this paper. We exploited ontology as a knowledge base to support indirect commands and remove user restrictions on expressing a specific set of commands. Moreover, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has been exploited for detecting spoken commands more accurately. Additionally, due to the lack of Persian voice commands for interacting with smart home appliances, a dataset of speaker-independent Persian voice commands for communicating with TV, media player, and lighting system has been designed, recorded, and evaluated in this research. The experimental results show that the LSTM-based voice command detection system performed almost 1.5% and 13% more accurately than the Hidden Markov Model-based one, in scenarios 'with' and 'without ontology', respectively. Furthermore, using ontology in the LSTM-based method has improved the system performance by about 40%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s10462-022-10326-x,0.0,,NOV 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000886130100001,0

SCA used linear transition rules to balance the exploration and exploitation searches while searching for the best or optimal solutions.

Due to the nonlinearity of decision maker's cognition, the gaps between adjacent linguistic terms are unbalanced. The unbalanced probabilistic linguistic term set (UPLTS) is proposed to present such situation. To this phenomenon, a resolution framework is constructed to analyze multiple attribute group decision-making problems under unbalanced probabilistic linguistic environment. Firstly, the integration model based on evidential reasoning theory is proposed to aggregate UPLTSs from different groups in view of incomplete probabilistic distributions in UPLTS. Secondly, the transformation function based on proportional 2 tuple is developed to transform UPLTS into probabilistic linguistic term set, making it easier for subsequent analysis and processing. Thirdly, Based on the multiple types of partitioned structure relationship among attributes, partitioned fuzzy measure is developed to globally capture these interactions among attributes. Then the probabilistic linguistic Choquet integral operator with partitioned fuzzy measure is proposed to obtain the comprehensive performances of alternatives.

Due to the ubiquity of Internet connectivity and smart devices, social sensing is emerging as a dynamic AI-driven sensing paradigm to extract real-time observations from online users. In this paper, we propose CovidSens, a vision of social sensing-based risk alert systems to spontaneously obtain and analyze social data to infer the state of the COVID-19 propagation. CovidSens can actively help to keep the general public informed about the COVID-19 spread and identify risk-prone areas by inferring future propagation patterns. The CovidSens concept is motivated by three observations: (1) people have been actively sharing their state of health and experience of the COVID-19 via online social media, (2) official warning channels and news agencies are relatively slower than people reporting their observations and experiences about COVID-19 on social media, and (3) online users are frequently equipped with substantially capable mobile devices that are able to perform non-trivial on-device computation for data processing and analytics. We envision an unprecedented opportunity to leverage the posts generated by the ordinary people to build a real-time sensing and analytic system for gathering and circulating vital information of the COVID-19 propagation. Specifically, the vision of CovidSens attempts to answer the questions: How to distill reliable information about the COVID-19 with the coexistence of prevailing rumors and misinformation in the social media? How to inform the general public about the latest state of the spread timely and effectively, and alert them to remain prepared? How to leverage the computational power on the edge devices (e.g., smartphones, IoT devices, UAVs) to construct fully integrated edge-based social sensing platforms for rapid detection of the COVID-19 spread? In this vision paper, we discuss the roles of CovidSens and identify the potential challenges in developing reliable social sensing-based risk alert systems. We envision that approaches originating from multiple disciplines (e.g., AI, estimation theory, machine learning, constrained optimization) can be effective in addressing the challenges.

Thus, this study carried out a review on the classification techniques for sarcasm identification under the aspects of datasets, pre-processing, feature engineering, classification algorithms, and performance metrics. The study has considered the published article from the period of 2008 to 2019. Forty (40) academic literature were selected from the 7 standard academic databases in order to carry out the review and realize the objectives. The study revealed that most researchers created their own datasets since there is no standard available datasets in the domain of sarcasm identification. Context and content-based linguistic features were used in most of the studies. This review shows that n-gram and parts of speech tagging techniques were the most commonly used feature extraction techniques. However, binary representation and term frequency were utilized for feature representation whereas Chi squared and information gain were used for the feature selection scheme. Moreover, classification algorithm such as support vector machine, Naive Bayes, random forest, maximum entropy, and decision tree algorithm were mostly applied using accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure for performance measures. Finally, research challenges and future direction are summarized in this review. This review reveals the impact of sarcasm identification in building effective product reviews and would serve as handle resources for researchers and practitioners in sarcasm identification and text classification in general.",,,,,"Shuib, Nor Liyana Mohd/M-8698-2013; Norman, Azah Anir/B-8276-2010; NWEKE, HENRY FRIDAY/U-8918-2019","Shuib, Nor Liyana Mohd/0000-0002-7907-0671; Norman, Azah Anir/0000-0001-5420-0452; NWEKE, HENRY FRIDAY/0000-0001-5196-764X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,AUG,2020.0,53.0,6,,,,,4215.0,4258,,10.1007/s10462-019-09791-8,0.0,,NOV 2019,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000499562600001,0

One of the most crucial aspects of developing games lies in modeling and predicting individual behavior, the study of computational models of players in games. Although model-based approaches have been considered standard for this purpose, their application is often extremely difficult due to the huge space of actions that can be created by educational games. For this reason, data-driven approaches have shown promise, in part because they are not completely reliant on expert knowledge. This study seeks to systematically review the existing research on the use of data-driven approaches in player modeling of educational games. The primary objectives of this study are to identify, classify, and bring together the relevant approaches. We have carefully surveyed a 10-year sample (2008-2017) of research studies conducted on data-driven approaches in player modeling of educational games, and thereby found 67 significant research works. However, our criteria for inclusion reduced the sample to 21 studies that addressed four primary research questions, and so we analyzed and classified the questions, methods, and findings of these published works, which we evaluated and from which we drew conclusions based on non-statistical methods. We found that there are three primary avenues along which data-driven approaches have been studied in educational games research: first, the objective of data-driven approaches in player modeling of educational games, namely behavior modeling, goal recognition, and procedural content generation; second, approaches employed in such modeling; finally, current challenges of using data-driven approaches in player modeling of educational games, namely game data, temporal forecasting in player models, statistical techniques, algorithmic efficiency, knowledge engineering, problem of generalizability, and data sparsity problem. In conclusion we addressed four critical future challenges in the area, namely, the lack of proper and rich data publicly available to the researchers, the lack of a data-driven method to identify conceptual features from log data, hybrid player modeling approaches, and data mining techniques for individual prediction.",,,,,"Hooshyar, Danial/X-5126-2018","Hooshyar, Danial/0000-0002-9143-6648",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,OCT,2019.0,52.0,3,,,,,1997.0,2017,,10.1007/s10462-017-9609-8,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000486256400014,0

Neural-network (NN) feature weighting, as a supervised method, is founded upon the mapping from input features to output decisions, and implemented by evaluating the sensitivity of network outputs to its inputs. Through training on sample data, NN implicitly embodies the saliencies of input features. The partial derivatives of the outputs with respect to the inputs in the trained NN are calculated to measure their sensitivities to input features, which means that implicit feature weighting of the NN is transformed into explicit feature weighting. The purpose of this paper is to further probe into the principle of NN feature weighting, and evaluate its performance through a comparative study between NN feature weighting method and state-of-art weighting methods in the same working conditions. The motivation of this study is inspired by the lack of direct and comprehensive comparison studies of NN feature weighting method. Experiments in UCI repository data sets, face data sets and self-built data sets show that NN feature weighting method achieves superior performance in different conditions and has promising prospects. Compared with the other existing methods, NN feature weighting method can be used in more complex conditions, provided that NN can work in those conditions. As decision data, output data can be labels, reals or integers.

Typically, such empirical sensor models are used in sensor calibration and fault monitoring systems. However, simultaneous optimization of related performance metrics, i.e., auto-sensitivity, cross-sensitivity, and fault-detectability, is not a trivial task. Learning procedures for parametric and other relevant non-parametric empirical models are sensitive to optimization and regularization methods. Therefore, there is a need for active learning strategies that can better exploit the underlying statistical structure among input sensors and are simple to regularize and fine-tune. To this end, we investigated the greedy layer-wise learning strategy and denoising-based regularization procedure for sensor model optimization. We further explored the effects of denoising-based regularization hyper-parameters such as noise-type and noise-level on sensor model performance and suggested optimal settings through rigorous experimentation. A visualization procedure was introduced to obtain insight into the internal semantics of the learned model. These visualizations allowed us to suggest an implicit noise-generating process for efficient regularization in higher-order layers. We found that the greedy-learning procedure improved the overall robustness of the sensor model. To keep experimentation unbiased and immune to noise-related artifacts in real sensors, the sensor data were sampled from simulators of a nuclear steam supply system of a pressurized water reactor and a Tennessee Eastman chemical process.

The classification of ESD requires an enormous amount of computational effort, as all the features of the diseases have more than 90 % commonality. Some of the approaches reported in literature are fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks, neuro-fuzzy models and support vector machine. Recently, AdaBoost and its hybrid algorithms are widely used to enhance the accuracy of the learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose AdaBoost and its hybrid algorithms for diagnosis of erythemato-squamous diseases for the first time. User-friendly-interface is designed to assist dermatologists to estimate the ESD with the help of 34 features includes patient's histopathological and clinical data sets. Efficient interface design is based on the following steps: (1) feature selection for all the 34 parameters involved in the erythemato-squamous disease is done using association rule based Apriori algorithm, (2) association rules are used to find of transactions (diseases) to meet of the features of the diseases, (3) support value of all the subset of transaction from of transactions is found and the dominant subset is found using Apriori algorithm, and (4) AdaBoost and its hybrid classifiers are used to classify the diseases. In this paper, the real, modest, gentle and hybrid AdaBoost algorithms are implemented and tested with the dataset of 366 patients. The data preprocessing reduces the dimensionality of the dataset and improves the time complexity of the estimation of the diseases.

Before applying clustering algorithms to datasets, it is usually necessary to preprocess the data properly. Data preprocessing is a crucial, still neglected step in data mining. Although preprocessing techniques and algorithms are well-known, the preprocessing process is very complex and takes usually a lot of time. Instead of handling preprocessing more systematically, it is usually undervalued, i.e. more emphasis is put on choosing the appropriate clustering algorithm and setting its parameters. In our opinion, this is not because preprocessing is less important, but because it is difficult to choose the best sequence of preprocessing algorithms. We argue that it is important to better standardize this process so it is performed efficiently. Therefore, this paper proposes a generic framework for data preprocessing. It is based on a survey with data mining experts, as well as a literature and software review. The framework enables pipelining preprocessing algorithms and methods which facilitate further automated preprocessing design and the selection of a suitable preprocessing stream. The proposed framework is easily extendible, so it can be applied to other data mining algorithm families that have their own idiosyncrasies.",,,,,"Kirchner, Kathrin/C-4984-2016","Kirchner, Kathrin/0000-0002-4638-0403",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,MAR,2016.0,45.0,3,,,,,271.0,297,,10.1007/s10462-015-9446-6,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000377827400001,0

J,"Neri, F; Tirronen, V",,,,"Neri, Ferrante; Tirronen, Ville",,,Recent advances in differential evolution: a survey and experimental analysis,ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW,,,,,,,,,,,,"Differential Evolution (DE) is a simple and efficient optimizer, especially for continuous optimization. For these reasons DE has often been employed for solving various engineering problems. On the other hand, the DE structure has some limitations in the search logic, since it contains too narrow a set of exploration moves. This fact has inspired many computer scientists to improve upon DE by proposing modifications to the original algorithm. This paper presents a survey on DE and its recent advances. A classification, into two macro-groups, of the DE modifications is proposed here: (1) algorithms which integrate additional components within the DE structure, (2) algorithms which employ a modified DE structure. For each macro-group, four algorithms representative of the state-of-the-art in DE, have been selected for an in depth description of their working principles. In order to compare their performance, these eight algorithm have been tested on a set of benchmark problems. Experiments have been repeated for a (relatively) low dimensional case and a (relatively) high dimensional case. The working principles, differences and similarities of these recently proposed DE-based algorithms have also been highlighted throughout the paper. Although within both macro-groups, it is unclear whether there is a superiority of one algorithm with respect to the others, some conclusions can be drawn. At first, in order to improve upon the DE performance a modification which includes some additional and alternative search moves integrating those contained in a standard DE is necessary. These extra moves should assist the DE framework in detecting new promising search directions to be used by DE. Thus, a limited employment of these alternative moves appears to be the best option in successfully assisting DE. The successful extra moves are obtained in two ways: an increase in the exploitative pressure and the introduction of some randomization. This randomization should not be excessive though, since it would jeopardize the search. A proper increase in the randomization is crucial for obtaining significant improvements in the DE functioning. Numerical results show that, among the algorithms considered in this study, the most efficient additional components in a DE framework appear to be the population size reduction and the scale factor local search. Regarding the modified DE structures, the global and local neighborhood search and self-adaptive control parameter scheme, recently proposed in literature, seem to be the most promising modifications.",,,,,"Neri, Ferrante/U-7036-2019; Neri, Ferrante/C-8306-2014","Neri, Ferrante/0000-0002-6100-6532; Neri, Ferrante/0000-0002-6100-6532",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,FEB,2010.0,33.0,1-2,,,,,61.0,106,,10.1007/s10462-009-9137-2,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000273807600003,0

Given these difficulties, it is therefore not surprising that a number of computer-based systems have been developed to speed-up and improve the quality of performance evaluation. Most of these systems are visually based such that individuals working on performance analysis first record the motion in question by electronic means and then input these images into a computer for quantification and subsequent analysis. There seems to be enormous potential for AI (i.e. Artificial Intelligence) technologies to make a significant contribution in the analysis phase.

For comparison purposes, a single RF model was also constructed to predict soil liquefaction. The developed models in this study were evaluated using four metrics, i.e., accuracy, recall, precision and F1-score (F1). Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic and precision-recall curves were also proposed for evaluation purposes. The results showed that the developed GA-RF and GWO-RF models can improve the performance of the original classifier. By comparing the two hybrid models, it was found that the GWO-RF performs better on two databases, i.e., CPT and SPT, while in the case of the SWVT database, the GA-RF has better performance. Considering a variety of metrics, the two hybrid models can be employed as powerful techniques to estimate soil liquefaction potential and may be feasible tools to assist technicians in making correct decisions. By implementing sensitivity analysis, the impact of each model predictor on soil liquefaction was evaluated, and the most influential parameters were identified.",,,,,"Zhou, Jian/M-2461-2018","Zhou, Jian/0000-0003-4769-4487",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,OCT,2022.0,55.0,7,,,,,5673.0,5705,,10.1007/s10462-022-10140-5,0.0,,FEB 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000758312300001,0

As a part of general clinical diagnoses, six knowledge bases corresponding to six chief complaints (arthralgia, dyspnea, cough and expectoration, epistaxis, fever with rash and abdominal pain) were constructed through constructing subgraphs relevant to a chief complaint separately and synthesizing them together as the knowledge base of the chief complaint.

Blockchain technology represents a useful underlying technology to ensure trust in cross-border remittances for major banks and financial institutions. The selection of the appropriate blockchain technology provider is viewed as a classic multicriteria group decision-making (MCGDM) problem, which can be resolved to assist major banks in enhancing the quality of cross-border work. This article presents a combined MCGDM technique uniting the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and TODIM, a Portuguese acronym for interactive multi-criteria decision making, for selecting an appropriate blockchain technology provider with Pythagorean fuzzy (PF) information. First, we establish hierarchical criteria for assessing the performance of blockchain technology providers in accordance with the available literature and characteristics of cross-border remittance work. Second, we adopt the PF-AHP technique to acquire relevant criterion weights, considering uncertainties of the decision-makers' judgments over the criteria. Third, we utilize the PF-TODIM technique to compute the relevant dominance degree of the providers, taking into account the decision-makers' psychological behaviors and preferences toward the risk of the blockchain technology. Fourth, we apply the proposed PF-AHP-TODIM technique to choose the appropriate blockchain provider for cross-border remittance work for a major bank and validate the efficiency and practicability of this hybrid technique over other available MCGDM methods.",,,,,,"Chen, Ting-Yu/0000-0002-2171-4139",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,OCT,2022.0,55.0,7,,,,,5411.0,5443,,10.1007/s10462-021-10128-7,0.0,,JAN 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000740212900001,0

The most successful techniques for automatically generating image captions have recently used attentive deep learning models. There are variations in the way deep learning models with attention are designed. In this survey, we provide a review of literature related to attentive deep learning models for image captioning. Instead of offering a comprehensive review of all prior work on deep image captioning models, we explain various types of attention mechanisms used for the task of image captioning in deep learning models. The most successful deep learning models used for image captioning follow the encoder-decoder architecture, although there are differences in the way these models employ attention mechanisms. Via analysis on performance results from different attentive deep models for image captioning, we aim at finding the most successful types of attention mechanisms in deep models for image captioning. Soft attention, bottom-up attention, and multi-head attention are the types of attention mechanism widely used in state-of-the-art attentive deep learning models for image captioning.

The data should be communicated securely between the communicating devices and therefore, network security is one of the dominant research areas for the current network scenario. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are therefore widely used along with other security mechanisms such as firewall and access control. Many research ideas have been proposed pertaining to the IDS using machine learning (ML) techniques, deep learning (DL) techniques, and swarm and evolutionary algorithms (SWEVO). These methods have been tested on the datasets such as DARPA, KDD CUP 99, and NSL-KDD using network features to classify attack types. This paper surveys the intrusion detection problem by considering algorithms from areas such as ML, DL, and SWEVO. The survey is a representative research work carried out in the field of IDS from the year 2008 to 2020. The paper focuses on the methods that have incorporated feature selection in their models for performance evaluation. The paper also discusses the different datasets of IDS and a detailed description of recent dataset CIC IDS-2017. The paper presents applications of IDS with challenges and potential future research directions.

CSA is a recent, nature-inspired meta-heuristic optimization algorithm. I-CSA differs from CSA by allowing application on a discrete problem, which is P-median and fortifying faster convergence to an optimal or near-optimal solution. Improvements are provided by local searches which support escaping from local optima or convergence to the optimal solution, elitism enhances the intensification through the utilization of nodes by selecting the most frequent centers that appeared in hiding better locations for local search, on the P-median problem. The application of the I-CSA is structured in three phases. In the first phase, parameters of I-CSA are analyzed and optimized using well-known data tests. The test datasets for the application of I-CSA on the P-median problem were retrieved from the OR-library to present the effectiveness and applicability of I-CSA. In the second phase, 40-pmed test problems from the library are solved using I-CSA and the results are compared with known optimal results and recorded results of other meta-heuristic approaches. In addition, Wilcoxon signed-rank test is applied in order to demonstrate the performance of I-CSA compared to well-known algorithms. The results of the proposed method demonstrated a faster convergence rate and better solution in most cases when compared with the standard CSA and other well-known meta-heuristic approaches. Finally, the proposed I-CSA approach is tested on a real-life case problem including 2121 nodes in Tunceli, Turkey. Obtaining the optimal results in a reasonable time indicates that the potential of the I-CSA is high and promising. In nutshell, this paper presents an improvement to CSA and evaluates its performance in a three-phase test procedure.",,,,,,"Ozceylan, Eren/0000-0002-5213-6335",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2821,1573-7462,,,,AUG,2021.0,54.0,6,,,,,4591.0,4617,,10.1007/s10462-021-10006-2,0.0,,APR 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000642849700003,0

Then a comparison between these operators is developed with the help of an example. The existing score function for T-spherical fuzzy sets does not involve abstinence so a new score function is developed which provides a better comparison between any two T-spherical fuzzy numbers. To demonstrate the presented algorithm, a decision-making process algorithm is presented with T-SFS features.
