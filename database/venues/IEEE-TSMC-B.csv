The Web Ontology Language (OWL) is the most expressive standard language for modeling ontologies, the cornerstone of the Semantic Web. However, up until now, no standard way of expressing time and time-dependent information in OWL has been provided. In this paper, we present a temporal extension of the very expressive fragment SHIN(D) of the OWL Description Logic language, resulting in the temporal OWL language. Through a layered approach, we introduce three extensions: 1) concrete domains, which allow the representation of restrictions using concrete domain binary predicates; 2) temporal representation, which introduces time points, relations between time points, intervals, and Allen's 13 interval relations into the language; and 3) timeslices/fluents, which implement a perdurantist view on individuals and allow for the representation of complex temporal aspects, such as process state transitions. We illustrate the expressiveness of the newly introduced language by using an example from the financial domain.",,,,,"Kaymak, Uzay/A-3364-2008; Frasincar, Flavius/AAC-8253-2021; Frasincar, Flavius/D-3171-2011; Milea, Viorel/J-2652-2014","Kaymak, Uzay/0000-0002-4500-9098; Frasincar, Flavius/0000-0002-8031-758X; Milea, Viorel/0000-0002-3203-514X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,FEB,2012,42,1,,,,,268,281,,10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2162582,0.0,,,,,,,,21878417.0,,,,,WOS:000302096700021,0

This paper presents a recurring two-stage evolutionary programming (RTEP) to balance the explorative and exploitative features of the conventional EAs. Unlike most previous works, RTEP is based on repeated and alternated execution of two different stages, namely, the exploration and exploitation stages, each with its own mutation operator, selection strategy, and explorative/exploitative objective. Both analytical and empirical studies have been carried out to understand the necessity of repeated and alternated exploration and exploitation operations in EAs. A suite of 48 benchmark numerical optimization problems has been used in the empirical studies.

We use a novel bootstrapping argument to prove the convergence of the algorithm. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such analysis has been carried out for zero-sum and identical payoff games. Extensive simulation studies are reported, which demonstrate the proposed algorithm's fast and accurate convergence in a variety of game scenarios.

ADP generally requires full information about the system internal states, which is usually not available in practical situations. In this paper, we show how to implement ADP methods using only measured input/output data from the system. Linear dynamical systems with deterministic behavior are considered herein, which are systems of great interest in the control system community. In control system theory, these types of methods are referred to as output feedback (OPFB). The stochastic equivalent of the systems dealt with in this paper is a class of partially observable Markov decision processes. We develop both policy iteration and value iteration algorithms that converge to an optimal controller that requires only OPFB. It is shown that, similar to Q-learning, the new methods have the important advantage that knowledge of the system dynamics is not needed for the implementation of these learning algorithms or for the OPFB control. Only the order of the system, as well as an upper bound on its observability index, must be known.

The PCFLARNN consists of a number of simple small-scale Chebyshev functional link artificial recurrent neural network (CFLARNN) modules. Compared to the standard recurrent neural network (RNN), those modules of PCFLARNN can simultaneously be performed in a pipelined parallelism fashion, and this would lead to a significant improvement in its total computational efficiency. Furthermore, contrasted with the architecture of a pipelined RNN (PRNN), each module of PCFLARNN is a CFLARNN whose nonlinearity is introduced by enhancing the input pattern with Chebyshev functional expansion, whereas the RNN of each module in PRNN utilizing linear input and first-order recurrent term only fails to utilize the high-order terms of inputs. Therefore, the performance of PCFLARNN can further be improved at the cost of a slightly increased computational complexity. In addition, due to the introduced nonlinear functional expansion of each module in PRNN, the number of input signals can be reduced. Computer simulations have demonstrated that the proposed filter performs better than PRNN and RNN for nonlinear colored signal prediction, nonstationary speech signal prediction, and chaotic time series prediction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,FEB,2010,40,1,,,,,162,172,,10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2024313,0.0,,,,,,,,19751995.0,,,,,WOS:000271440600015,0

The proposed framework operates on the change in quaternion between consecutive data frames (the DQ), which avoids the heavy computational burden of the quaternion motion equation. Head velocity is estimated from the DQ by an EKF and then used to predict future head orientation.

To effectively arrive at meaningful solutions in a vast array of problem-solving tasks, it becomes imperative to establish a sound machinery of reconciling findings which might form partial solutions to an overall problem. In this paper, we focus on a broad category of problems of collaborative data analysis realized by a collection of agents having access to their individual data and exchanging findings through their collaboration activities. Such problems of data analysis arise in the context of building a global view at a certain phenomenon (process) by viewing it from different perspectives (and thus engaging various collections of attributes by various agents). Our goal is to develop some interaction between the agents so that they could form an overall perspective, where the knowledge available locally is shared and reconciled. The underlying format of knowledge built by the agents is that of information granules and fuzzy sets in particular. We develop a comprehensive optimization scheme and discuss its two-phase nature in which the communication phase of the granular findings intertwines with the local optimization being realized by the agents at the level of the individual datasite and exploits the evidence collected from other sites. We show how the mechanism of fuzzy granulation realized in the form of a well-known fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering can be augmented to support collaborative activities required by the agents. For this purpose, we introduce augmented versions of the original objective function used in the FCM and derive algorithmic details. We also discuss an issue of optimizing the strength of collaborative linkages, so that the reconciled findings attain the highest level of consistency (agreement).

It combines a global method of feature selection and a fuzzy linguistic rule classifier. It is applied to an industrial fabric textile context. The aim of the global vision system is to identify textile fabric defects. From the related industrial process, the training data sets are small, and some are incomplete. Moreover, the recognition step must be compatible with the time constant of the system, which generally imposes low complexity for the system. The choice of the most relevant features and the reduction of their number are important to respect these constraints. The feature selection method is based on the analysis of indexes extracted on the lattice defined from training in relation with the Choquet integral. This selection step is embedded in an iterative algorithm to discard weaker features in order to decrease the number of rules while keeping good recognition rates. The recognition step is done with a fuzzy reasoning classifier that is well adapted for this application case. The proposed method is quite efficient with small learning data sets because of the generalization capacity of both the feature selection and recognition steps. The experimental study shows the wanted behavior of this approach: the feature number decreases, whereas the recognition rate increases.

With the lower and upper membership functions, the parameter uncertainties can be effectively captured. Based on the interval type-2 T-S fuzzy model, an interval type-2 fuzzy controller is proposed to close the feedback loop. To facilitate the stability analysis, the information of the footprint of uncertainty is used to develop some membership function conditions, which allow the introduction of slack matrices to handle the parameter uncertainties in the stability analysis.

However, existing approaches cannot provide accurate transformations for mosaics when it comes to aligning images because of the plastic distortion that may occur due to the nonuniform contact between a finger and a sensor or the deficiency of the correspondences in the images. In this paper, we propose a new scheme for mosaicking fingerprint images, which iteratively matches ridges to overcome the deficiency of the correspondences and compensates for the amount of plastic distortion between two partial images by using a thin-plate spline model. The proposed method also effectively eliminates erroneous correspondences and decides how well the transformation is estimated by calculating the registration error with a normalized distance map. The proposed method consists of three phases: feature extraction, transform estimation, and mosaicking. Transform is initially estimated with matched minutia and the ridges attached to them. Unpaired ridges in the overlapping area between two images are iteratively matched by minimizing the registration error, which consists of the ridge matching error and the inverse consistency error. During the estimation, erroneous correspondences are eliminated by considering the geometric relationship between the correspondences and checking if the registration error is minimized or not. In our experiments, the proposed method was compared with three existing methods in terms of registration accuracy, image quality, minutia extraction rate, processing time, reject to fuse rate, and verification performance. The average registration error of the proposed method was less than three pixels, and the maximum error was not more than seven pixels. In a verification test, the equal error rate was reduced from 10% to 2.7% when five images were combined by our proposed method. The proposed method was superior to other compared methods in terms of registration accuracy, image quality, minutia extraction rate, and verification.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,OCT,2007,37,5,,,,,1191,1203,,10.1109/TSMCB.2007.907038,0.0,,,,,,,,17926702.0,,,,,WOS:000249594500011,0

Tensors are higher order extensions of vectors and matrices, which make it possible to analyze different appearance factors of facial variation. Using higher order tensors, we can construct a multilinear structure and model the multiple factors of face variation. In particular, among the appearance factors, the factor of a person's identity modeled by a tensor structure can be used for face recognition. However, this tensor-based face recognition creates difficulty in factorizing the unknown parameters of a new test image and solving for the person-identity parameter. In this paper, to break this limitation of applying the tensor-based methods to face recognition, we propose a novel tensor approach based on an individual-modeling method and nonlinear mappings. The proposed method does not require the problematic tensor factorization and is more efficient than the traditional TensorFaces method with respect to computation and memory. We set up the problem of solving for,the unknown factors as a least squares problem with a quadratic equality constraint and solve it using numerical optimization techniques. We show that an individual-multilinear approach reduces the order of the tensor so that it makes face-recognition tasks computationally efficient as well as analytically simpler. We also show that nonlinear kernel mappings can be applied to this optimization problem and provide more accuracy to face-recognition systems than linear mappings. In this paper, we show that the proposed method, Individual Kernel TensorFaces, produces the better discrimination power for classification. The novelty in our approach as compared to previous work is that the Individual Kernel TensorFaces method does not require estimating any factor of a new test image for face recognition. In addition, we do not need to have any a priori knowledge of or assumption about the factors of a test image when using the proposed method. We can apply Individual Kernel TensorFaces even if the factors of a test image are absent from the training set.

However, such treatment does not take the advantage of the flexibility offered by multiple AGVs. In general, it is intractable to obtain maximally permissive control policy for either problem.

Then the two models are integrated by using macro transitions. Based on the combined model, a novel control policy for deadlock avoidance is proposed. It is shown to be maximally permissive with computational complexity of O(n(2)) where n is the number of machines in AMS if the complexity for controlling the part transportation by AGVs is not considered.

Foremost among these are the prototypes for nearest neighbor classifiers, the vector quantization technique, and the support vector machines. These methods suffer from a major disadvantage, namely, that of the excessive computational burden encountered by processing all the data. In this paper, we suggest a recursive and computationally superior mechanism referred to as adaptive recursive partitioning (ARP)_PRS. Rather than process all the data using a PRS, we propose that the data be recursively subdivided into smaller subsets. This recursive subdivision can be arbitrary, and need not utilize any underlying clustering philosophy. The advantage of ARP_PRS is that the PRS processes subsets of data points that effectively sample the entire space to yield smaller subsets of prototypes. These prototypes are then, in turn, gathered and processed by the PRS to yield more refined prototypes. In this manner, prototypes which are in the interior of the Voronoi spaces, and thus ineffective in the classification, are eliminated at the subsequent invocations of the PRS. We are unaware of any PRS that employs such a recursive philosophy. Although we marginally forfeit accuracy in return for computational efficiency, our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed recursive mechanism yields classification comparable to the best reported prototype condensation schemes reported to-date. Indeed, this is true for both artificial data sets and for samples involving real-life data sets. The results especially demonstrate that a fair computational advantage can be obtained by using such a recursive strategy for large data sets, such as those involved in data mining and text categorization applications.",,,,,"Oommen, B.

In this paper, we model temporal sources as a general multivariate auto-regressive (AR) process whereby an underlying multivariate AR process in observation space is obtained. In this dual AR modeling, the mixing process from temporal sources to observations is the same as the mixture from the nontemporal residuals of the source AR (SAR) process to that of the observation AR (OAR) process. We can therefore avoid the source temporal effects in performing ICA by learning the demixing system on the independently distributed OAR residuals rather than the time-correlated observations. Particularly, we implement this approach by modeling each source signal as a finite mixture of generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (GARCH) process.

Our method provides detailed manipulation plans, including any intermediate motion of the pusher while changing contact configuration with the pushed movables, Given a pushing problem, a pushing path is found using a two-phase procedure: a context sensitive back propagation of a cost function which maps the configuration space, and a gradient descent phase which builds the pushing path, Both phases are based on a dynamic neighborhood filter which constrains each step to consider only admissible neighboring configurations. This admissibility mechanism provides a primary tool for expressing the special characteristics of the pushing manipulation. It also allows for a full integration of any geometrical constraints imposed by the pushing robot, the pushed movables and the environment.

Most of the existing fuzzy rule-based systems have difficulties in deriving inference rules and membership functions directly from training data, Rules and membership functions are obtained from experts. Some approaches use backpropagation (BP) type learning algorithms to learn the parameters of membership functions from training data. However, BP algorithms take a long time to converge and they require an advanced setting of the number of inference rules. The work to determine the number of inference rules demands lots of experiences from the designer. In this paper, self-organizing learning algorithms are proposed for the fuzzy inference networks. In the proposed learning algorithms, the number of inference rules and the membership functions in the inference rules will be automatically determined during the training procedure. The learning speed is fast. The proposed fuzzy inference network (FIN) classifiers possess both the structure and the learning ability of neural networks, and the fuzzy classification ability of fuzzy algorithms.

The primary reason for slow learning is the global nature of backpropagation. Another reason is the fact that a neuron in an MLP network functions as a hyperplane separator and is therefore inefficient when applied to classification problems in which decision boundaries are nonlinear. This paper presents a data representational approach that addresses these problems while operating within the framework of the familiar backpropagation model. We examine the use of receptors with overlapping receptive fields as a preprocessing technique for encoding inputs to MLP networks. The proposed data representation scheme, termed ensemble encoding, is shown to promote local learning and to provide enhanced nonlinear separability. Simulation results for well known problems in classification and time-series prediction indicate that the use of ensemble encoding can significantly reduce the time required to train MLP networks.

Motivated by this, our algorithm uses a strategy for assessing the hyperplanes in such a way that the geometric structure in the data is taken into account.

The main method in this paper is a combination of the finite-volume method (FVM) with Delaunay triangulation to solve the Laplace equations in the harmonic transformation of face images. The advantages of the FVM with Delaunay triangulation are given as follows: 1) easy to formulate the linear algebraic equations; 2) good in retaining the pertinent geometric and physical need; and 3) less central processing unit time needed. Numerical and graphical experiments have been conducted for the face transformation from a female (woman) to a male (man), and vice versa. The computed sequential errors are O(N ((3/2))), where N(2) is the division number of a pixel into subpixels. These computed errors coincide with the analysis on the splitting-shooting method (SSM) with piecewise constant interpolation in the previous paper of Li and Bai. In computation, the average absolute errors of restored pixel grayness can be smaller than 2 out of 256 grayness levels. The FVM is as simple as the finite-difference method (FDM) and as flexible as the finite-element method (FEM).

However, the performance of gait recognition will suffer in the low-resolution (LR) case. Furthermore, when gait sequences are projected onto a nonoptimal low-dimensional subspace to reduce the data complexity, the performance of gait recognition will also decline. To deal with these two issues, we propose a new algorithm called superresolution with manifold sampling and backprojection (SRMS), which learns the high-resolution (HR) counterparts of LR test images from a collection of HR/LR training gait image patch pairs. Then, we incorporate SRMS into a new algorithm called multilinear tensor-based learning without tuning parameters (MTP) for LR gait recognition. Our contributions include the following: 1) With manifold sampling, the redundancy of gait image patches is remarkably decreased; thus, the superresolution procedure is more efficient and reasonable. 2) Backprojection guarantees that the learned HR gait images and the corresponding LR gait images can be more consistent. 3) The optimal subspace dimension for dimension reduction is automatically determined without introducing extra parameters. 4) Theoretical analysis of the algorithm shows that MTP converges.

We propose to study contract-based network resource allocation. In our model, users and nodes in the network make contracts before nodes route traffic for the users. The problem is an interesting self-interested negotiation problem because it requires the complete assembly of a set of distinct resources, and there are multiple combinations of distinct resources that could satisfy the goal of negotiation. First, we characterize the network allocation problem and show that finding optimal allocations is NP-complete and is inapproximable. We take both Nash equilibrium and pairwise Nash equilibrium as the solution concepts to characterize the equilibrium allocations. We find that, for any resource allocation game, Nash equilibrium and pairwise Nash equilibrium always exist. In addition, socially optimal allocations are always supported by Nash equilibrium and pairwise Nash equilibrium. We introduce best-response dynamics in which each agent takes a myopic best-response strategy and interacts with each other to dynamically form contracts.

This paper proposes a novel inference mechanism for an interval type-2 Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy logic control system (IT2 TSK FLCS) when antecedents are type-2 fuzzy sets and consequents are crisp numbers (A2-C0). The proposed inference mechanism has a closed form which makes it more feasible to analyze the stability of this FLCS. This paper focuses on control applications for the following cases: 1) Both plant and controller use A2-C0 TSK models, and 2) the plant uses type-1 Takagi-Sugeno (TS) and the controller uses IT2 TS models. In both cases, sufficient stability conditions for the stability of the closed-loop system are derived. Furthermore, novel linear-matrix-inequality-based algorithms are developed for satisfying the stability conditions. Numerical analyses are included which validate the effectiveness of the new inference methods. Case studies reveal that an IT2 TS FLCS using the proposed inference engine clearly outperforms its type-1 TSK counterpart. Moreover, due to the simple nature of the proposed inference engine, it is easy to implement in real-time control systems.

In this paper, we propose a two-stage algorithm named tensor-based Riemannian manifold distance-approximating projection (TRIMAP), which can quickly compute an approximately optimal projection for a given tensor data set. In the first stage, we construct a graph from labeled or unlabeled data, which correspond to the supervised and unsupervised scenario, respectively, such that we can use the graph distance to obtain an upper bound on an objective function that preserves pairwise geodesic distances. Then, we perform some tensor-based optimization of this upper bound to obtain a projection onto a low-dimensional subspace. In the second stage, we propose three different strategies to enhance the discrimination ability, i.e., make data points from different classes easier to separate and make data points in the same class more compact. Experimental results on two benchmark data sets from the University of South Florida human gait database and the Face Recognition Technology face database show that the discrimination ability of TRIMAP exceeds that of other popular algorithms.

However, visibility, which is a fundamental requirement of object tracking, is insufficient for automated persistent surveillance. In such applications, a continuous consistently labeled trajectory of the same object should be maintained across different camera views. Therefore, a sufficient uniform overlap between the cameras' FOVs should be secured so that camera handoff can successfully and automatically be executed before the object of interest becomes untraceable or unidentifiable. In this paper, we propose sensor-planning methods that improve existing algorithms by adding handoff rate analysis. Observation measures are designed for various types of cameras so that the proposed sensor-planning algorithm is general and applicable to scenarios with different types of cameras. The proposed sensor-planning algorithm preserves necessary uniform overlapped FOVs between adjacent cameras for an optimal balance between coverage and handoff success rate. In addition, special considerations such as resolution and frontal-view requirements are addressed using two approaches: 1) direct constraint and 2) adaptive weights.

The advantages of EDA are that, compared with principal component analysis (PCA) + LDA, the EDA method can extract the most discriminant information that was contained in the null space of a within-class scatter matrix, and compared with another LDA extension, i.e., null-space LDA (NLDA), the discriminant information that was contained in the non-null space of the within-class scatter matrix is not discarded. Furthermore, EDA is equivalent to transforming original data into a new space by distance diffusion mapping, and then, LDA is applied in such a new space. As a result of diffusion mapping, the margin between different classes is enlarged, which is helpful in improving classification accuracy.

We propose a novel 2.5-D approach to real-time multiobject tracking in crowds, which is formulated as a maximum a posteriori estimation problem and is approximate through an assignment step and a location step. Observing that the occluding object is usually less affected by the occluded objects, sequential solutions for the assignment and the location are derived. A novel dominant color histogram (DCH) is proposed as an efficient object model. The DCH can be regarded as a generalized color histogram, where dominant colors are selected based on a given distance measure. Comparing with conventional color histograms, the DCH only requires a few color components (31 on average). Furthermore, our theoretical analysis and evaluation on real data have shown that DCHs are robust to illumination changes. Using the DCH, efficient implementations of sequential solutions for the assignment and location steps are proposed. The assignment step includes the estimation of the depth order for the objects in a dispersing group, one-by-one assignment, and feature exclusion from the group representation. The location step includes the depth-order estimation for the objects in a new group, the two-phase mean-shift location, and the exclusion of tracked objects from the new position in the group. Multiobject tracking results and evaluation from public data sets are presented. Experiments on image sequences captured from crowded public environments have shown good tracking results, where about 90% of the objects have been successfully tracked with the correct identification numbers by the proposed method.

The method uses a technique for estimating the principal curvatures and Darboux frame from range images. After estimating the principal curvatures and the Darboux frames from the entire scene, a search for the known patterns of these features in geometric primitives is performed. If a specific pattern is identified, then the presence of the corresponding primitive is confirmed by using these local features. The features are also used to recover the primitive's characteristics. The suggested application is very efficient since it combines the segmentation, classification, and fitting processes, which are part of any recovery process, in a single process, which advances monotonously through the recovery procedure. We view the problem as a robust statistics problem, and we therefore use techniques from that field. A mean-shift-based algorithm is used for the robust estimation of shape parameters, such as recognizing which types of shapes in the scene exist and, after that, full recovery of planes, spheres, and cylinders. A random-sample-consensus-based algorithm is used for robust model estimation for the more complex primitives, such as cones and tori. As a result of these algorithms, a set of proposed primitives is found. This set contains superfluous models which cannot be detected at this stage. To deal with this problem, a minimum-description-length method has been developed, which selects a subset of models that best describes the scene. The method has been tested on series of real complex cluttered scenes, yielding accurate and robust recoveries of primitives.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,JUN,2008,38,3,,,,,826,845,,10.1109/TSMCB.2008.918567,0.0,,,,,,,,18558545.0,,,,,WOS:000258763600020,0

The random packet loss is assumed to obey the Bernoulli random binary distribution, and the parameter uncertainties are norm-bounded and enter into both the system and output matrices. In the presence of random packet losses, an observer-based feedback controller is designed to robustly exponentially stabilize the networked system in the sense of mean square and also achieve the prescribed H-infinity disturbance-rejection-attenuation level.

Knowing the speaker's location (i.e., speaker localization) not only improves the enhancement results of a corrupted signal, but also provides assistance to speaker identification. Since conventional speech localization algorithms suffer from the uncertainties of environmental complexity and noise, as well as from the microphone mismatch problem, they are frequently not robust in practice. Without a high reliability, the acceptance of speech-based HCI would never be realized. This work presents a novel speaker's location detection method and demonstrates high accuracy within a vehicle cabinet using a single linear microphone array. The proposed approach utilize Gaussian mixture models (GMM) to model the distributions of the phase differences among the microphones caused by the complex characteristic of room acoustic and microphone mismatch. The model can be applied both in near-field and far-field situations in a noisy environment. The individual Gaussian component of a GMM represents some general location-dependent but content and speaker-independent phase difference distributions. Moreover, the scheme performs well not only in nonline-of-sight cases, but also when the speakers are aligned toward the microphone array but at difference distances from it. This strong performance can be achieved by exploiting the fact that the phase difference distributions at different locations are distinguishable in the environment of a. car.

Oblique decision trees classify the patterns by testing on linear combinations of the input attributes. As a result, an oblique decision tree is usually much smaller than the univariate tree generated for the same domain. Our algorithm consists of two components: connectionist and symbolic. A three-layer feedforward neural network is constructed and pruned, a decision tree is then built from the hidden unit activation values of the pruned network. An oblique decision tree is obtained by expressing the activation values using the original input attributes. We test our algorithm on a wide range of problems.

Thus, we do not need to extract this group of features when new data comes. A novel approach is also proposed to iteratively obtain similar and dissimilar pairs from both the keyword similarity and the relevance feedback. Thus, keyword similarity is modeled in the annotation framework. We also show that our framework can be employed in image retrieval tasks by selecting different image pairs. Extensive experiments are designed to compare the performance between features, feature combinations, and regularization-based feature selection methods applied on the image annotation task, which gives insight into the properties of features in the image annotation task. The experimental results demonstrate that the group-sparsity-based method is more accurate and stable than others.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,JUN,2012,42,3,,,,,838,849,,10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2179533,0.0,,,,,,,,22249744.0,,,,,WOS:000304163200021,0

Five sensor models are considered: one obtained from classical estimation theory and four obtained from Bernoulli, Poisson, binomial, and mixture-of-binomial distributions. A systematic approach is presented for deriving information functions that represent the expected utility of future sensor measurements from mutual information, Renyi divergence, Kullback-Leibler divergence, information potential, quadratic entropy, and the Cauchy-Schwarz distance. The resulting information-driven strategies are compared to direct-search, alert-confirm, task-driven (TS), and log-likelihood-ratio (LLR) search strategies. Extensive numerical simulations show that quadratic entropy typically leads to the most effective search strategy with respect to correct-classification rates. In the presence of prior information, the quadratic-entropy-driven strategy also displays the lowest rate of false alarms.

Cutting-plane methods have traditionally been used as an effective tool in devising exact algorithms for solving convex and large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. Its utilization in nonconvex optimization has been also promising. A cutting plane, essentially a hyperplane defined by a linear inequality, can be used to effectively reduce the computational efforts in search of a global solution. Each cut is generated in order to eliminate a large portion of the search domain. Thus, a deep cut is intuitively superior in which it will exclude a larger set of extraneous points from consideration. This paper is concerned with the development of deep-cutting-plane techniques applied to reverse-convex programs. An upper bound and a lower bound for the optimal value are found, updated, and improved at each iteration.

Cluster validity indices are commonly used to select the best partitioning from different clustering results; however, they are often inadequate unless clusters are well separated or have parametrical shapes. Prototype-based clustering (finding of clusters by grouping the prototypes obtained by vector quantization of the data), which is becoming increasingly important for its effectiveness in the analysis of large high-dimensional data sets, adds another dimension to this challenge. For validity assessment of prototype-based clusterings, previously proposed indexes-mostly devised for the evaluation of point-based clusterings-usually perform poorly. The poor performance is made worse when the validity indexes are applied to large data sets with complicated cluster structure. In this paper, we propose a new index, Conn_Index, which can be applied to data sets with a wide variety of clusters of different shapes, sizes, densities, or overlaps. We construct Conn_Index based on inter-and intra-cluster connectivities of prototypes. Connectivities are defined through a connectivity matrix, which is a weighted Delaunay graph where the weights indicate the local data distribution. Experiments on synthetic and real data indicate that Conn_Index outperforms existing validity indices, used in this paper, for the evaluation of prototype-based clustering results.",,,,,"Tasdemir, Kadim/K-8385-2016","Tasdemir, Kadim/0000-0001-7519-1911",,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,,,,,AUG,2011,41,4,,,,,1039,1053,,10.1109/TSMCB.2010.2104319,0.0,,,,,,,,21296711.0,,,,,WOS:000293708200013,0

We also propose an efficient importance distribution to produce relevant particles, which is dedicated to the proposed fuzzy framework. The fuzzy modeling provides flexibility both in the semantics of information and in the transitions from one instant to another one. This allows one to take into account situations where a tracked object changes its direction in a quite abrupt way and where poor prior information on dynamics is available, as demonstrated on synthetic data. As an illustration, two tests on real video sequences are performed in this paper. The first one concerns a classical tracking problem and shows that our approach efficiently tracks objects with complex and unknown dynamics, outperforming classical filtering techniques while using only a small number of particles.

Constructive algorithms provide an attractive automatic way of determining a near-optimal ANN architecture for a given problem. Several such algorithms have been proposed in the literature and shown their effectiveness. This paper presents a new constructive algorithm (NCA) in automatically determining ANN architectures. Unlike most previous studies on determining ANN architectures, NCA puts emphasis on architectural adaptation and functional adaptation in its architecture determination process. It uses a constructive approach to determine the number of hidden layers in an ANN and of neurons in each hidden layer. To achieve functional adaptation, NCA trains hidden neurons in the ANN by using different training sets that were created by employing a similar concept used in the boosting algorithm. The purpose of using different training sets is to encourage hidden neurons to learn different parts or aspects of the training data so that the ANN can learn the whole training data in a better way. In this paper, the convergence and computational issues of NCA are analytically studied. The computational complexity of NCA is found to be O(W x P-t x t), where W is the number of weights in the ANN, Pt is the number of training examples, and t is the number of training epochs. This complexity has the same order as what the backpropagation learning algorithm requires for training a fixed ANN architecture. A set of eight classification and two approximation benchmark problems was used to evaluate the performance of NCA. The experimental results show that NCA can produce ANN architectures with fewer hidden neurons and better generalization ability compared to existing constructive and nonconstructive algorithms.",,,,,"Murase, Kazuyuki/O-4881-2014; YAO, XIN/W-2158-2018","Murase, Kazuyuki/0000-0002-2358-995X; YAO, XIN/0000-0001-8837-4442",,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,DEC,2009,39,6,,,,,1590,1605,,10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2021849,0.0,,,,,,,,19502131.0,,,,,WOS:000270143800021,0

The SPL problem involves a general learning problem in which the learning mechanism (which could be a robot, a learning automaton, or, in general, an algorithm) attempts to learn a parameter, for example, lambda*, within a closed interval. However, unlike the earlier reported results, we consider the scenario when the learning is to be done in a nonstationary setting. For each guess, the environment essentially informs the mechanism, possibly erroneously (i.e., with probability p), which way it should move to reach the unknown point. Unlike the results available in the literature, we consider the fascinating case when the point sought for is itself stochastically moving (which is modeled as follows). The environment communicates with an intermediate entity (referred to as the teacher/oracle) about the point itself, i.e., advising where it should go. The mechanism that searches for the point in turn receives responses from the teacher/oracle, which directs how it should move. Therefore, the point itself, in the overall setting, is moving, i.e., delivering possibly incorrect information about its location to the teacher/oracle. This in turn means that the environment is itself nonstationary, which implies that the advice of the teacher/oracle is both uncertain and changing with time-rendering the problem extremely fascinating. The heart of the strategy we propose involves discretizing the space and performing a controlled random walk on this space.

However, very few counterparts of previous planar navigation systems were developed for 3-D motion, which is needed for both unmanned aerial and underwater vehicles. A novel fuzzy behavioral scheme for navigating an unmanned helicopter in cluttered 3-D spaces is developed. The 3-D navigation problem is decomposed into several identical 2-D navigation subproblems, each of which is solved by using preference-based fuzzy behaviors. Due to the shortcomings of vector summation during the fusion of the 2-D subproblems, instead of directly outputting steering subdirections by their own defuzzification processes, the intermediate preferences of the subproblems are fused to create a 3-D solution region, representing degrees of preference for the robot movement. A new defuzzification algorithm that steers the robot by finding the centroid of a 3-D convex region of maximum volume in the 3-D solution region is developed. A fuzzy speed-control system is also developed to ensure efficient and safe navigation.

Although CMAC was proposed many years ago, several open questions have been left even for today. The most important ones are about its modeling and generalization capabilities. The limits of its modeling capability were addressed in the literature, and recently, certain questions of its generalization property were also investigated. This paper deals with both the modeling and the generalization properties of CMAC. First, a new interpolation model is introduced. Then, a detailed analysis of the generalization error is given, and an analytical expression of this error for some special cases is presented. It is shown that this generalization error can be rather significant, and a simple regularized training algorithm to reduce this error is proposed. The results related to the modeling capability show that there are differences between the one-dimensional (1-D) and the multidimensional versions of CMAC. This paper discusses the reasons of this difference and suggests a new kernel-based interpretation of CMAC. The kernel interpretation gives a unified framework. Applying this approach, both the 1-D and the multidimensional CMACs can be constructed with similar modeling capability. Finally, this paper shows that the regularized training algorithm can be applied for the kernel interpretations too, which results in a network with significantly improved approximation capabilities.",,,,,"Horvath, Gabor/G-8920-2012","Horvath, Gabor/0000-0001-9657-1219",,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,FEB,2007,37,1,,,,,124,138,,10.1109/TSMCB.2006.881295,0.0,,,,,,,,17278566.0,,,,,WOS:000244131800014,0

We classify the merging relationship between two involved characters into three types: linear, nonlinear, and overlapped.

The weakness of handling the nonlinear and overlapped types results from character segmentation by linear, usually vertical, cuts assumed in these methods. This paper proposes a novel merged character segmentation and recognition method based on forepart prediction, necessity-sufficiency matching and character-adaptive masking. This method utilizes the information obtained from the forepart of merged characters to predict candidates for the leftmost character, and then applies character-adaptive masking and character recognition to verifying the prediction. Therefore, the arbitrary-shaped cutting path will follow the right shape of the leftmost character so as to preserve the shape of the next character.

Efficient implementation of incremental data mining methods is, thus, becoming crucial for ensuring system scalability and facilitating knowledge discovery when data is dynamic and distributed.

We then show how to parallelize this incremental algorithm. We also propose a distributed asynchronous algorithm, which imposes minimal communication overhead. for mining distributed dynamic datasets. Our distributed approach is capable of generating local models (in which each site has a summary of its own database) as well as the global model of frequent itemsets (in which all sites have a summary of the entire database).

The front-scan sonar proposed in this paper is a new equipment devoted to acquiring a 2-D image of the seafloor to sail over, and allows one to collect a sequence of images showing a specific feature during the approach of the ship. This fact seems to make it possible to recover the 3-D position of a feature by comparing the feature positions along the sequence of images acquired from different (known) ship positions. This opportunity is investigated in the paper, where it is shown that encouraging results have been obtained by a processing chain composed of some blocks devoted to low-level processing, feature extraction and analysis, a Kalman filter for robust feature tracking, and some ad hoc equations for depth estimation and averaging. A statistical error analysis demonstrated the great potential of the proposed system also if some inaccuracies affect the sonar measures and the knowledge of the ship position.

Notice that reducing irrelevant features is synonymous here with selecting those features that provide best classification performance; the metric for making data-reducing decisions is an analytic for the probability of error conditioned on the training data. To illustrate its performance, the BDRA is applied both to simulated and to real data, and it is also compared to other classification methods. Further, the algorithm is extended to deal with the problem of missing features in the data. Results demonstrate that the BDRA performs well despite its relative simplicity.

Thus it is guaranteed that the maximum error reduction can be achieved by choosing the optimal learning rate for the next training iteration. A dynamic fuzzy neural network (FNN) that consists of the fuzzy linguistic process as the premise part and the two-layer NN as the consequence part is then illustrated as an immediate application of our approach, Each part of this dynamic FNN has its own learning rate for training purpose. A genetic algorithm is designed to allow a more efficient tuning process of the two learning rates of the FNN. The objective of the genetic algorithm is to reduce the searching time by searching for only one learning rate, which is the learning rate of the premise part, in the FNN.

Fuzzy logic systems are used to approximate the unstructured uncertainties, K-filters are designed to estimate the unmeasured states, and a special Nussbaum gain function is introduced to solve the problem of unknown high-frequency gain sign. Combining the backstepping technique with adaptive fuzzy control theory, an adaptive fuzzy decentralized robust output feedback control scheme is developed. In order to obtain the stability of the closed-loop system, a new lemma is given and proved.

A strong point of the model is that it is designed to track a variety of motions which are usually encountered in applications such as pedestrian tracking, hand tracking, and sports. We call the dynamic model a two-stage dynamic model due to its particular structure, which is a composition of two models: a liberal model and a conservative model. The liberal model allows larger perturbations in the target's dynamics and is able to account for motions in between the random-walk dynamics and the nearly constant-velocity dynamics. On the other hand, the conservative model assumes smaller perturbations and is used to further constrain the liberal model to the target's current dynamics. We implement the two-stage dynamic model in a two-stage probabilistic tracker based on the particle filter and apply it to two separate examples of blob tracking: 1) tracking entire persons and 2) tracking of a person's hands. Experiments show that, in comparison to the widely used models, the proposed two-stage dynamic model allows tracking with smaller number of particles in the particle filter (e.g., 25 particles), while achieving smaller errors in the state estimation and a smaller failure rate. The results suggest that the improved performance comes from the model's ability to actively adapt to the target's motion during tracking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,DEC,2010,40,6,,,,,1505,1520,,10.1109/TSMCB.2010.2041662,0.0,,,,,,,,20215085.0,,,,,WOS:000284364400008,0

Our algorithm, named as LAL Random Early Detection (LALRED), is founded on the principles of the operations of existing RED congestion-avoidance mechanisms, augmented with a LAL philosophy. The primary objective of LALRED is to optimize the value of the average size of the queue used for congestion avoidance and to consequently reduce the total loss of packets at the queue. We attempt to achieve this by stationing a LAL algorithm at the gateways and by discretizing the probabilities of the corresponding actions of the congestion-avoidance algorithm. At every time instant, the LAL scheme, in turn, chooses the action that possesses the maximal ratio between the number of times the chosen action is rewarded and the number of times that it has been chosen. In LALRED, we simultaneously increase the likelihood of the scheme converging to the action, which minimizes the number of packet drops at the gateway. Our approach helps to improve the performance of congestion avoidance by adaptively minimizing the queue-loss rate and the average queue size.

Recently, biometric cryptosystems have been introduced as a reliable way of concealing private keys by using biometric data. A fuzzy vault refers to a biometric cryptosystem that can be used to effectively protect private keys and to release them only when legitimate users enter their biometric data. In biometric systems, a critical problem is storing biometric templates in a database. However, fuzzy vault systems do not need to directly store these templates since they are combined with private keys by using cryptography. Previous fuzzy vault systems were designed by using fingerprint, face, and so on. However, there has been no attempt to implement a fuzzy vault system that used an iris. In biometric applications, it is widely known that an iris can discriminate between persons better than other biometric modalities. In this paper, we propose a reliable fuzzy vault system based on local iris features. We extracted multiple iris features from multiple local regions in a given iris image, and the exact values of the unordered set were then produced using the clustering method.

First, a comparative study of a newly developed dynamical multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (DMOEA) and some modern algorithms, such as the indicator-based evolutionary algorithm, multiple single objective Pareto sampling, and nondominated sorting genetic algorithm 11, is presented by employing the convergence metric and relative hypervolume metric. For three scalable test problems (namely, DTLZ1, DTLZ2, and DTLZ6), which represent some of the most difficult problems studied in the literature, the DMOEA shows good performance in both converging to the true Pareto-optimal front and maintaining a widely distributed set of solutions. Second, a new definition of optimality (namely, L-optimality) is proposed in this paper, which not only takes into account the number of improved objective values but also considers the values of improved objective functions if all objectives have the same importance. We prove that L-optimal solutions are subsets of Pareto-optimal solutions. Finally, the new algorithm based on L-optimality (namely, MDMOEA) is developed, and simulation and comparative results indicate that well-distributed L-optimal solutions can be obtained by utilizing the MDMOEA but cannot be achieved by applying L-optimality to make a posteriori selection within the huge Pareto nondominated solutions.

The other problem is adaptation: among the numerous possible models that could be constructed for representing a given environment, optimization involves the selection of one that improves as much as possible the operations of the robot.

The idea of the nonparallel-distributed-compensation (non-PDC) control laws is extended to the continuous-time fuzzy-model-based control systems. A nonlinear controller with non-PDC control laws is proposed to stabilize the continuous-time nonlinear systems in Takagi-Sugeno's form. To produce the stability-analysis result, a parameter-dependent Lyapunov function (PDLF) is employed. However, two difficulties are usually encountered: 1) the time-derivative terms produced by the PDLF will complicate the stability analysis and 2) the stability conditions are not in the form of linear-matrix inequalities (LMIs) that aid the design of feedback gains. To tackle the first difficulty, the time-derivative terms are represented by some weighted-sum terms in some existing approaches, which will increase the number of stability conditions significantly. In view of the second difficulty, some positive-definitive terms are added in order to cast the stability conditions into LMIs. In this correspondence, the favorable properties of the membership functions and nonlinear control laws,,which allow the introduction of some free matrices, are employed to alleviate the two difficulties while retaining the favorable properties of PDLF-based approach.

It involves finding the shortest path in a single-source stochastic graph topology where there are continuous probabilistic updates in the edge-weights. The algorithm is significantly more efficient than the existing solutions, and can be used to find the statistical shortest path tree in the average graph topology. It converges to this solution irrespective of whether there are new changes in edge-weights taking place or not. In such random settings, the proposed learning automata solution converges to the set of shortest paths. On the other hand, the existing algorithms will fail to exhibit such a behavior, and would recalculate the affected shortest paths after each weight-change. The important contribution of the proposed algorithm is that all the edges in a stochastic graph are not probed, and even if they are, they are not all probed equally often. Indeed, the algorithm attempts to almost always probe only those edges that will be included in the shortest path graph, while probing the other edges minimally. This increases the performance of the proposed algorithm. All the algorithms were tested in environments where edge-weights change stochastically, and where the graph topologies undergo multiple simultaneous edge-weight updates. Its superiority in terms of the average number of processed nodes, scanned edges and the time per update operation, when compared with the existing algorithms, was experimentally established.

Multiple model (MM) estimation schemes track these system evolutions by applying a bank of filters, one for each discrete system mode. Modern systems, however, are often composed of many interconnected components that exhibit rich behaviors, due to complex, system-wide interactions. Modeling these systems leads to complex stochastic hybrid models that capture the large number of operational and failure modes. This large number of modes makes a typical MM estimation approach infeasible for online estimation. This paper analyzes the shortcomings of MM estimation, and then introduces an alternative hybrid estimation scheme that can efficiently estimate complex systems with large number of modes. It utilizes search techniques from the toolkit of model-based reasoning in order to focus the estimation on the set of most likely modes, without missing symptoms that might be hidden amongst the system noise. In addition, we present a novel approach to hybrid estimation in the presence of unknown behavioral modes.

Our major effort focuses on the prosodic information generation. New methodologies for constructing fuzzy rules in a prosodic model simulating human's pronouncing rules are developed. The proposed Recurrent Fuzzy Neural Network (RFNN) is a multilayer recurrent neural network (RNN) which integrates a Self-constructing Neural Fuzzy Inference Network (SONFIN) into a recurrent connectionist structure. The RFNN can be functionally divided into two,parts. The first part adopts the SONFIN as a prosodic model to explore the relationship between high-level linguistic features and prosodic information based on fuzzy inference rules. As compared to conventional neural networks, the SONFIN can always construct itself with an economic network size in high learning speed. The second part employs a five-layer network to generate all prosodic parameters by directly using the prosodic fuzzy rules inferred from the first part as well as other important features of syllables. The TTS system combined with the proposed method can behave not only sandhi rules but also the other prosodic phenomena existing in the traditional TTS systems. Moreover, the proposed scheme can even find out some new rules about prosodic phrase structure. The performance of the proposed RFNN-based prosodic model is verified by imbedding it into a Chinese TTS system with a Chinese monosyllable database based on the time-domain pitch synchronous overlap add (TD-PSOLA) method. Our experimental results show that the proposed RFNN can generate proper prosodic parameters including pitch means, pitch shapes, maximum energy levels, syllable duration, and pause duration.

Such agents exhibit adaptive, incremental, exploratory, and sometimes explosive learning behaviors, Learning in adaptive neurofuzzy control, however, is often referred to as global training with a large set of random examples and a very low learning rate. This type of controller is not reorganizable; it cannot explain exploratory learning behaviors as exhibited by human and animal species. A theory of coordinated computational intelligence (CCI) is proposed in this paper which leads to a reorganizable: multiagent cerebellar architecture for intelligent control, The architecture is based on the hypotheses that 1) a cerebellar system consists of a school of relatively simple and cognitively identifiable semiautonomous neurofuzzy agents; 2) autonomous control is the result of cerebellar agent fine-tuning and coordination rather than complicate computation; and 3) learning is accomplished via individual cerebellar agent learning and coordinated discovery in a leaning-tuning-brainstorming process. Agent-oriented decomposition and coordination algorithms are introduced; necessary and sufficient conditions are established for cerebellar agent discovery and common Sense cerebellar motion law discovery. Nesting, safety, layering, and autonomy-four principles are analytically formulated for the reorganization of neurofuzzy agents, The four Principles extend Saridis' principle of increasing intelligence with decreasing precision for hierarchical control to multiagent neurofuzzy control, and bridge a gap between neurofuzzy control and PID control, adaptive learning and exploratory learning, numerical learning and symbolic learning. Basic ideas are illustrated in legged locomotion and gymnastics. It is shown that, with agent-oriented decomposition, a single near-miss example can enable the cerebellar agents of a 3-link or 4-link uniped simulation to learn gymnastic jumps; a small number of fine-tuned agents can form a kernel community which can discover common sense cerebellar motion laws; and a kernel governed by the laws can grow with a geometrical learning rate.

Subpixel mapping may provide a fine-resolution map of class labels from coarser spectral unmixing fraction images, with the assumption of spatial dependence. In ADESM, to utilize DE, the subpixel mapping problem is transformed into an optimization problem by maximizing the spatial dependence index. The traditional DE algorithm is an efficient and powerful population-based stochastic global optimizer in continuous optimization problems, but it cannot be applied to the subpixel mapping problem in a discrete search space. In addition, it is not an easy task to properly set control parameters in DE. To avoid these problems, this paper utilizes an adaptive strategy without user-defined parameters, and a reversible-conversion strategy between continuous space and discrete space, to improve the classical DE algorithm. During the process of evolution, they are further improved by enhanced evolution operators, e. g., mutation, crossover, repair, exchange, insertion, and an effective local search to generate new candidate solutions. Experimental results using different types of remote images show that the ADESM algorithm consistently outperforms the previous subpixel mapping algorithms in all the experiments. Based on sensitivity analysis, ADESM, with its self-adaptive control parameter setting, is better than, or at least comparable to, the standard DE algorithm, when considering the accuracy of subpixel mapping, and hence provides an effective new approach to subpixel mapping for remote sensing imagery.",,,,,"Zhong, Yanfei/F-3532-2010",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,OCT,2012,42,5,,,,,1306,1329,,10.1109/TSMCB.2012.2189561,0.0,,,,,,,,22510950.0,,,,,WOS:000308995500002,0

Increasing illumination on the eye causes the pupil of the eye to contract, while decreasing illumination causes the pupil to dilate. Visible light causes specular reflections inside the iris ring. On the other hand, the human retina is less sensitive to near infra-red (NIR) radiation in the wavelength range from 800 nm to 1400 nm, but iris detail can still be imaged with NIR illumination. In order to measure the dynamic movement of the human pupil and iris while keeping the light-induced reflexes from affecting the quality of the digitalized image, this paper describes a device based on the consensual reflex. This biological phenomenon contracts and dilates the two pupils synchronously when illuminating one of the eyes by visible light. In this paper, we propose to capture images of the pupil of one eye using NIR illumination while illuminating the other eye using a visible-light pulse. This new approach extracts iris features called dynamic features (DFs). This innovative methodology proposes the extraction of information about the way the human eye reacts to light, and to use such information for biometric recognition purposes. The results demonstrate that these features are discriminating features, and, even using the Euclidean distance measure, an average accuracy of recognition of 99.1% was obtained.

In this paper, we consider dynamic shortest path-planning problems on a graph with a single endpoint pair and with potentially changing edge weights over time. Several algorithms exist in the literature that solve this problem, notably among them the Lifelong Planning A* (LPA*) algorithm. The LPA* algorithm is an incremental search algorithm that replans the path when there are changes in the environment. In numerical experiments, however, it was observed that the performance of LPA* is sensitive in the number of vertex expansions required to update the graph when an edge weight value changes or when a vertex is added or deleted. Although, inmost cases, the classical LPA* requires a relatively small number of updates, in some other cases the amount of work required by the LPA* to find the optimal path can be overwhelming. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose an extension of the baseline LPA* algorithm, by making efficient use of a multiscale representation of the environment. This multiscale representation allows one to quickly localize the changed edges, and subsequently update the priority queue efficiently. This incremental multiscale LPA* (m-LPA* for short) algorithm leads to an improvement both in terms of robustness and computational complexity-in the worst case-when compared to the classical LPA*.

Focal sets are propagated in system equations using interval arithmetics and constraint-satisfaction techniques, thus generalizing pure interval analysis. This model was used to locate a land vehicle using a dynamic fusion of Global Positioning System measurements with dead reckoning sensors. The method has been shown to provide more accurate estimates of vehicle position than does the bounded-error method while retaining what is essential: providing guaranteed computations.

To this end, the head pose observations are modeled using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) or a hidden Markov model (HMM) whose hidden states correspond to the VFOA. The novelties of this paper are threefold. First, contrary to previous studies on the topic, in our setup, the potential VFOA of a person is not restricted to other participants only. It includes environmental targets as well (a table and a projection screen), which increases the complexity of the task, with more VFOA targets spread in the pan as well as tilt gaze space. Second, we propose a geometric model to set the GMM or HMM parameters by exploiting results from cognitive science on saccadic eye motion, which allows the prediction of the head pose given a gaze target. Third, an unsupervised parameter adaptation step not using any labeled data is proposed, which accounts for the specific gazing behavior of each participant. Using a publicly available corpus of eight meetings featuring four persons, we analyze the above methods by evaluating, through objective performance measures, the recognition of the VFOA from head pose information obtained either using a magnetic sensor device or a vision-based tracking system. The results clearly show that in such complex but realistic situations, the VFOA recognition performance is highly dependent on bow well the visual targets are separated for a given meeting participant.

In this paper, an adaptive nonlinear controller is designed to regulate the states of two dynamic systems that collide. The academic example of a planar robot colliding with an unactuated mass-spring system is used to represent a broader class of such systems. The control objective is defined as the desire to command a robot to collide with an unactuated system and regulate the mass to a desired compressed state while compensating for the unknown constant system parameters. Lyapunov-based methods are used to develop a continuous adaptive controller that yields asymptotic regulation of the mass and robot links.

Although EAs have proven their ability to explore large search spaces, they are comparatively inefficient in fine tuning the solution. This drawback is usually avoided by means of local optimization algorithms that are applied to the individuals of the population. The algorithms that use local optimization procedures are usually called hybrid algorithms. On the other hand, it is well known that the clustering process enables the creation of groups (clusters) with mutually close points that hopefully correspond to relevant regions of attraction. Local-search procedures can then be started once in every such region. This paper proposes the combination of an EA, a clustering process, and a local-search procedure to the evolutionary design of product-units neural networks. In the methodology presented, only a few individuals are subject to local optimization. Moreover, the local optimization algorithm is only applied at specific stages of the evolutionary process.

This type of parallel mechanism possesses several favorable properties: 1) its number of DOFs is independent of the number of serial chains which make up the mechanism; 2) it has no kinematical singularities; 3) it is designed to move on rails, and therefore its workspace is much larger than that of a conventional parallel manipulator; and 4) without changing the number of DOFs and the kinematics of the mechanisms, the number of the serial chains can be reconfigured according to the needs of the tasks. These properties make the mechanism very preferable in practice, especially for such tasks as joining huge ship blocks, in which the manipulated objects vary dramatically both in weights and dimensions. Furthermore, the mechanism can be used as either a fully actuated system or an underactuated system. In the fully actuated case, the mechanism has six DOF motion capabilities and manipulation capabilities. However, in the underactuated case, the mechanism still has six DOF motion capabilities, but it has only five DOF manipulation capabilities.

Specifically, we use a reduced-form genetic algorithm (RGA) to adjust the weightings of the fuzzy-neural network. In RGA, a sequential-search-based crossover point (SSCP) method determines a suitable crossover point before a single gene crossover actually takes place so that the speed of searching for an optimal weighting vector of the fuzzy-neural network can be improved.

A number of methods have been proposed to overcome a) well. In contrast, work on b) and c) has not been sufficient; techniques have not been generalized to more general optimization problems. Thus this paper mathematically resolves b) and c) to such an extent that the resolution can be applied to solving with some general network continuous optimization problems including the Hopfield version of the TSP. It first constructs an Extended HM (E-HM) that overcomes both b) and c). Fundamental techniques of the E-HM lie in the addition of a synapse dynamical system cooperated with the current HM unit dynamical system. It is this synapse dynamical system that makes the TSP constraint hold at any final states for whatever choices of the HM parameters and an initial state. The paper then generalizes the E-HM further to a network that can solve a class of continuous optimization problems with a constraint equation where both of the objective function and the constraint function are nonnegative and continuously differentiable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,,,,,DEC,1998,28,6,,,,,906,919,,10.1109/3477.735403,0.0,,,,,,,,18256012.0,,,,,WOS:000077156000018,0

An approximate optimal control design method is proposed on the basis of the empirical eigenfunctions (EEFs) and neural network (NN). First, based on the data collected from the PDE system, the Karhunen-Loeve decomposition is used to compute the EEFs. With those EEFs, the PDE system is formulated as a high-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) system. To further reduce its dimension, the singular perturbation (SP) technique is employed to derive a reduced-order model (ROM), which can accurately describe the dominant dynamics of the PDE system. Second, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) method is applied to synthesize an optimal controller based on the ROM, where the closed-loop asymptotic stability of the high-order ODE system can be guaranteed by the SP theory. By dividing the optimal control law into two parts, the linear part is obtained by solving an algebraic Riccati equation, and a new type of HJB-like equation is derived for designing the nonlinear part. Third, a control update strategy based on successive approximation is proposed to solve the HJB-like equation, and its convergence is proved. Furthermore, an NN approach is used to approximate the cost function. Finally, we apply the developed approximate optimal control method to a diffusion-reaction process with a nonlinear spatial operator, and the simulation results illustrate its effectiveness.",,,,,"LUO, Biao/E-8174-2011; Wu, Huai-Ning/K-7466-2012","LUO, Biao/0000-0002-3353-2586; Wu, Huai-Ning/0000-0002-4366-5147",,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,DEC,2012,42,6,,,,,1538,1549,,10.1109/TSMCB.2012.2194781,0.0,,,,,,,,22588610.0,,,,,WOS:000311353700003,0

The core technique is a novel maximum likelihood (ML)-based algorithm which combines the multimodel detections in mean-shift tracking. First, a likelihood probability which integrates detections and similarity to local appearance is defined. Then, an expectation-maximization (EM)-like mean-shift algorithm is derived under the ML framework. In each iteration, the E-step estimates the associations to the detections, and the M-step locates the new position according to the ML criterion. To be robust to the complex crowded scenarios for multiperson tracking, an improved sequential strategy to perform the mean-shift tracking is proposed. Under this strategy, human objects are tracked sequentially according to their priority order. To balance the efficiency and robustness for real-time performance, at each stage, the first two objects from the list of the priority order are tested, and the one with the higher score is selected. The proposed method has been successfully implemented on real-world service and social robots.

In this paper, we propose a new mutation strategy, a fitness-induced parent selection scheme for the binomial crossover of DE, and a simple but effective scheme of adapting two of its most important control parameters with an objective of achieving improved performance. The new mutation operator, which we call DE/current-to-gr_best/1, is a variant of the classical DE/current-to-best/1 scheme. It uses the best of a group (whose size is q% of the population size) of randomly selected solutions from current generation to perturb the parent (target) vector, unlike DE/current-to-best/1 that always picks the best vector of the entire population to perturb the target vector. In our modified framework of recombination, a biased parent selection scheme has been incorporated by letting each mutant undergo the usual binomial crossover with one of the p top-ranked individuals from the current population and not with the target vector with the same index as used in all variants of DE. A DE variant obtained by integrating the proposed mutation, crossover, and parameter adaptation strategies with the classical DE framework (developed in 1995) is compared with two classical and four state-of-the-art adaptive DE variants over 25 standard numerical benchmarks taken from the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation 2005 competition and special session on real parameter optimization. Our comparative study indicates that the proposed schemes improve the performance of DE by a large magnitude such that it becomes capable of enjoying statistical superiority over the state-of-the-art DE variants for a wide variety of test problems.

Moreover, iExpand strategically deals with many issues that exist in traditional collaborative-filtering approaches, such as the overspecialization problem and the cold-start problem.

The proposed method begins by finding the most reliable spanning tree and most unreliable cut set in the given network. Their operative and failing probabilities are used to update the lower and upper bounds of the ATR. Subnetworks are then produced, corresponding to each state of the spanning tree or cut set. This procedure is applied to the subnetworks in a recursive manner to update the ATR bounds further, until either the lower or upper bound reaches the preset ATR requirement. Due to the rapid convergence of the ATR bounds, the feasibility of a given network is likely to be decided at an early stage of the network factoring process.

First, the procedure of a walking gait is redefined into three states, and the parameters of this designed walking gait are determined. Then, the machine learning approach applied to adjusting the walking parameters is policy gradient RL (PGRL), which can execute real-time performance and directly modify the policy without calculating the dynamic function. Given a parameterized walking motion designed for biped robots, the PGRL algorithm automatically searches the set of possible parameters and finds the fastest possible walking motion. The reward function mainly considered is first the walking speed, which can be estimated from the vision system. However, the experiment illustrates that there are some stability problems in this kind of learning process. To solve these problems, the desired zero moment point trajectory is added to the reward function. The results show that the robot not only has more stable walking but also increases its walking speed after learning. This is more effective and attractive than manual trial-and-error tuning. LPI, moreover, is employed to transform the existing motions to the motion which has a revised angle determined by the fuzzy motion controller. Then, the biped robot can continuously walk in any desired direction through this fuzzy motion control. Finally, the fuzzy-based gait synthesis control is demonstrated by tasks and point-and line-target tracking. The experiments show the feasibility and effectiveness of gait learning with PGRL and the practicability of the proposed fuzzy motion control scheme.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,JUN,2011,41,3,,,,,736,748,,10.1109/TSMCB.2010.2089978,0.0,,,,,,,,21095871.0,,,,,WOS:000290734400011,0

In classical terms, the notion of stability inherently associates with any dynamical system and determines whether a system under consideration reaches equilibrium after being exposed to disturbances. Predominantly, this concept comes with a binary (Boolean) quantification (viz., we either quantify that systems are stable or not stable). While in some cases, this definition is well justifiable, with the growing complexity and diversity of systems one could seriously question the Boolean nature of the definition and its underlying semantics. This becomes predominantly visible in human-oriented quantification of stability in which we commonly encounter statements quantifying stability through some linguistic terms such as, e.g., absolutely unstable, highly unstable, ... , absolutely stable, and alike. To formulate human-oriented definitions of stability, we may resort ourselves to the use of a so-called Precisiated Natural Language, which comes as a subset of natural language and one of whose functions is redefining existing concepts, such as stability, optimality, and alike. Being prompted by the discrepancy of the definition of stability and the Boolean character of the concept itself, in this paper, we introduce and develop a Generalized Theory of Stability (GTS) for analysis of complex dynamical systems described by fuzzy differential equations. Different human-centric definitions of stability of dynamical systems are introduced. We also discuss and contrast several fundamental concepts of fuzzy stability, namely, fuzzy stability of systems, binary stability of fuzzy system, and binary stability of systems by showing that all of them arise as special cases of the proposed GTS. The introduced definitions offer an important ability to quantify the concept of stability using some continuous quantification (that is through the use of degrees of stability). In this manner, we radically depart from the previous binary character of the definition. We establish some criteria concerning generalized stability for a wide class of continuous dynamical systems. Next, we present a series of illustrative examples which demonstrate the essence of the concept, and at the same time, stress that the existing Boolean techniques are not capable of capturing the essence of linguistic stability. We also apply the obtained results to investigate the stability of an economical system and show its usefulness in the design of nonlinear fuzzy control systems given some predefined degree of stability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,,,,,AUG,2009,39,4,,,,,971,988,,10.1109/TSMCB.2008.2010523,0.0,,,,,,,,19336332.0,,,,,WOS:000267865200015,0

The framework is comprised of the following two modules: a posture labeling module and a VLMM atomic action learning and recognition module. First, a posture template selection algorithm, based on a modified shape context matching technique, is developed. The selected posture templates form a codebook that is used to convert input posture sequences into discrete symbol sequences for subsequent processing. Then, the VLMM technique is applied to learn the training symbol sequences of atomic actions. Finally, the constructed VLMMs are transformed into hidden Markov models (HMMs) for recognizing input atomic actions.

The sensors are assumed to be of threshold test (pass/fail) type, but to be vulnerable to noise, in that occasionally true failures are missed, and likewise, there can be false alarms.

Extra resources are exploited into higher efficiency and faster learning in CL as compared to that of individual learning (IL). In the real world, however, implementation of CL is not a straightforward task, in part due to possible differences in area of expertise (AOE). In this paper, reinforcement-learning homogenous agents are considered in an environment with multiple goals or tasks. As a result, they become expert in different domains with different amounts of expertness. Each agent uses a one-step Q-learning algorithm and is capable of exchanging its Q-table with those of its teammates. Two crucial questions are addressed in this paper: How the AOE of an agent can be extracted? and How agents can improve their performance in CL by knowing their AOEs? An algorithm is developed to extract the AOE based on state transitions as a gold standard from a behavioral point of view. Moreover, it is discussed that the AOE can be implicitly obtained through agents' expertness in the state level. Three new methods for CL through the combination of Q-tables are developed and examined for overall performance after CL. The performances of developed methods are compared with that of IL, strategy sharing (SS), and weighted SS (WSS). Obtained results show the superior performance of AOE-based methods as compared to that of existing CL methods, which do not use the notion of AOE.

One of the main difficulties in using EHW to solve real-world problems is scalability, which limits the size of the circuit that may be evolved. This paper outlines a new type of decomposition strategy for EHW, the generalized disjunction decomposition (GDD), which allows the evolution of large circuits. The proposed method has been extensively tested, not only with multipliers and parity bit problems traditionally used In the EHW community, but also with logic circuits taken from the Microelectronics Center of North Carolina (MCNC) benchmark library and randomly generated circuits. In order to achieve statistically relevant results, each analyzed logic circuit has been evolved 100 times, and the average of these results is presented and compared with other EHW techniques. This approach is necessary because of the probabilistic nature of EA; the same logic circuit may not be solved in the same way if tested several times. The proposed method has been examined in an extrinsic EHW system using the (1 + lambda) evolution strategy. The results obtained demonstrate that GDD significantly improves the evolution of logic circuits in terms of the number of generations, reduces computational time as it is able to reduce the required time for a single iteration of the EA, and enables the evolution of larger circuits never before evolved.

This causes expensive computational cost and sometimes the singularity problem.

This problem occurs when the number of training samples is smaller than the dimensionality of feature vector. In turn, the within-class scatter matrix will become singular. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a new kernel machine-based one-parameter regularized Fisher discriminant (K1PRFD) technique. K1PRFD is developed based on our previously developed one-parameter regularized discriminant analysis method and the well-known kernel approach. Therefore, K1PRFD consists of two parameters, namely the regularization parameter and kernel parameter.

In stereovision matching, the following constraints are commonly used: epipolar, similarity, smoothness, ordering, and uniqueness. We propose a new strategy in which such constraints are sequentially combined. The goal is to achieve high performance in terms of correct matches by combining several strategies. The contributions of this paper are reflected in the development of a similarity measure through a support vector machines classification approach; the transformation of the smoothness, ordering and epipolar constraints into the form of an energy function, through an optimization simulated annealing approach, whose minimum value corresponds to a good matching solution and by introducing specific conditions to overcome the violation of the smoothness and ordering constraints.

First, an orthogonal design is utilized to initialize the number of input features and candidate parameters stored in GS. Then, the features are randomly selected according to the first grid acquired from the first step. These features and the candidate parameters are then passed to LSSVM. Finally, an artificial bee colony algorithm, the recently popular heuristic algorithm, is used to optimize parameters for LSSVM learning.

In such situations, a single method or one-step mining is often limited in discovering informative knowledge. It would also be very time and space consuming, if not impossible, to join relevant large data sources for mining patterns consisting of multiple aspects of information. It is crucial to develop effective approaches for mining patterns combining necessary information from multiple relevant business lines, catering for real business settings and decision-making actions rather than just providing a single line of patterns. The recent years have seen increasing efforts on mining more informative patterns, e. g., integrating frequent pattern mining with classifications to generate frequent pattern-based classifiers. Rather than presenting a specific algorithm, this paper builds on our existing works and proposes combined mining as a general approach to mining for informative patterns combining components from either multiple data sets or multiple features or by multiple methods on demand. We summarize general frameworks, paradigms, and basic processes for multifeature combined mining, multisource combined mining, and multimethod combined mining. Novel types of combined patterns, such as incremental cluster patterns, can result from such frameworks, which cannot be directly produced by the existing methods.

In this paper, we discuss nonlinear data distortion using potentially nonlinear random data transformation and show how it can be useful for privacy-preserving anomaly detection from sensitive data sets. We develop bounds on the expected accuracy of the nonlinear distortion and also quantify privacy by using standard definitions. The highlight of this approach is to allow a user to control the amount of privacy by varying the degree of nonlinearity. We show how our general transformation can be used for anomaly detection in practice for two specific problem instances: a linear model and a popular nonlinear model using the sigmoid function. We also analyze the proposed nonlinear transformation in full generality and then show that, for specific cases, it is distance preserving.

The problem is investigated and solved for two types of fusion schemes: 1) parallel decision fusion and 2) serial decision fusion. The Pareto optimal solutions are obtained using two different multiobjective optimization techniques. The normal boundary intersection (NBI) method converts the multiobjective problem into a number of single objective-constrained subproblems, where each subproblem can be solved with appropriate optimization methods and nondominating sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II), which is a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm. In our simulations, NBI yielded better and evenly distributed Pareto optimal solutions in a shorter time as compared with NSGA-II. The simulation results show that, instead of only minimizing the probability of error, multiobjective optimization provides a number of design alternatives, which achieve significant energy savings at the cost of slightly increasing the best achievable decision error probability.

However, indoor scenes are characterized by poorly localizable features. As a result, indoor feature tracking without artificial markers is challenging and remains an attractive problem. We propose to solve this problem by constraining the locations of a large number of nondistinctive features by several planar homographies which are strategically computed using distinctive features. We experimentally show the need for multiple homographies and propose an illumination-invariant local-optimization scheme for motion refinement. The use of a large number of nondistinctive features within the constraints imposed by planar homographies allows us to gain robustness. Also, the lesser computation cost in estimating these nondistinctive features helps to maintain the efficiency of the proposed method.

While there are considerable research efforts to characterize the key features of the K-means clustering algorithm, further investigation is needed to understand how data distributions can have impact on the performance of K-means clustering. To that end, in this paper, we provide a formal and organized study of the effect of skewed data distributions on K-means clustering. Along this line, we first formally illustrate that K-means tends to produce clusters of relatively uniform size, even if input data have varied true cluster sizes. In addition, we show that some clustering validation measures, such as the entropy measure, may not capture this uniform effect and provide misleading information on the clustering performance. Viewed in this light, we provide the coefficient of variation (CV) as a necessary criterion to validate the clustering results. Our findings reveal that K-means tends to produce clusters in which the variations of cluster sizes, as measured by CV, are in a range of about 0.3-1.0. Specifically, for data sets with large variation in true cluster sizes (e.g., CV > 1.0), K-means reduces variation in resultant cluster sizes to less than 1.0. In contrast, for data sets with small variation in true cluster sizes (e.g., CV < 0.3), K-means increases variation in resultant cluster sizes to greater than 0.3. In other words, for the earlier two cases, K-means produces the clustering results which are away from the true cluster distributions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,APR,2009,39,2,,,,,318,331,,10.1109/TSMCB.2008.2004559,0.0,,,,,,,,19095536.0,,,,,WOS:000264630500002,0

In this paper, a feasibility study based on separation discrimination is conducted. Two types of ideal detectors are considered. The first is the stimulus defined statistically (SDS) detector by Geisler and Davilla. The second is one that estimates the uncertainty and then takes out its effect. In the first method, an array of many ideal stimulus defined exactly (SDE) detectors covers uncertainties and forms the ideal SDS detector. When the separation distance between the SDE detectors is around 1 arcmin, the SDS detector can achieve nearly optimal performance. To cover the motion uncertainty with nearly optimal performance, the SDE detector at each position needs to cover 16 directions, and at each direction, it needs to cover speeds with an increment of 0.5 degrees /s. Typically, the SDS detector needs 7776 SDE detectors to deal with a speed up to 2 degrees /s stimulus movement with a randomly selected direction and a 9 min x 9 min position uncertainty region. This ideal observer can achieve a hyperacuity threshold of 2-4 arcsec. Its threshold is almost constant over the range of speeds covered by the SDS detector. Using the second method, position estimation and motion tracking capability is examined. With perfect position estimation and motion tracking, the SDS detector can be reduced to a single SDE detector that is tuned to correct position and motion direction and speed. Two lower bounds on the estimation variance are examined, namely: 1) the Cramer-Rao bound and 2) the Ziv-Zakai bound. The results showed that if an estimation algorithm that can achieve the performance of bounds can be found, then the second method could achieve a hyperacuity capability of 1 s or less. The human visual system may more likely adopt the first method, but the second is simpler to use in building up a device using microprocessors. In this paper, dot-pair templates are used, which precisely match to dot-pair stimuli, to compute the likelihood and make a decision. The main difference between this paper and that of Geisler and Davilla lies in using a discrete sum over an array of SDE detectors to closely approximate continuous integration over the uncertain region, which makes it much easier in hardware implementation.",,,,,"Levi, Dennis/J-7836-2019","Levi, Dennis/0000-0002-5350-8639; Li, Roger/0000-0002-1666-0543",,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,APR,2007,37,2,,,,,385,397,,10.1109/TSMCB.2006.883871,0.0,,,,,,,,17416166.0,,,,,WOS:000245109300013,0

This is in contrast to genetic algorithms that use the whole database as training patterns for evolution. Additionally, for each chromosome, a parameter called age is defined that implies the progress of the updating process. Similarly, the genes of the proposed chromosomes are divided into two categories: evolutionary genes that participate to evolution and history genes that save previous states of the updating process. Furthermore, a new fitness function is defined which evaluates the fitness of the chromosomes of the current population with different ages in each generation.

In this paper other two combinations, CUM and C&IM, of splitting integrating methods for T-1T are provided.

Since combination CSIM causes large greyness errors, it well suited to a few greyness level images, but needs a huge computation work for 256 greyness level images of enlarged transformations (see [16]). We may instead choose combination CIIM which involves nonlinear solutions. However, the improved combination CI#IM may bypass the nonlinear solutions completely.

Examples are the Falcon-ART, [12] and the POPFNN family of networks, [14]. A cluster analysis is first performed on the training data and the fuzzy rules are subsequently derived through the proper connections of these computed clusters.

These deficiencies are essentially inherent to the fuzzy ART, [3] clustering technique employed by the Falcon-ART network. Hence, two clustering techniques-Fuzzy Kohonen Partitioning (FKP) and its pseudo variant PFKP, [1] are synthesized with the basic Falcon structure to compute the fuzzy sets and to automatically derive the fuzzy rules from the training data.

Then, the original signal is transformed into a string of vectors of primitives, where each vector of primitives replaces a signal segment in the original signal. The string, in turn, is presented to the HFA characterizing that particular condition. Each set of HFA consists of a main automaton identifying the entire signal, and several sub-automata each identifying a particular significant structure in the signal.

The hybrid adaptive FNN controller, the free parameters of which can be tuned on-line by observer-based output feedback control law and adaptive law, is a combination of direct and indirect adaptive FNN controllers. A weighting factor, which can be adjusted by the tradeoff between,plant knowledge and control knowledge, is adopted to sum together the control efforts from indirect adaptive FNN controller and direct adaptive FNN controller. Furthermore, a supervisory controller is appended into the FNN controller to force the state to be within the constraint set. Therefore, if the FNN controller cannot maintain the stability, the supervisory controller starts working to guarantee stability.

The generation of a fuzzy rule base has generally been accomplished by a heuristic analysis of the relationships of the underlying system or by algorithmic rule generation from training data. Automatic rule generation has utilized clustering algorithms, proximity analysis, and evolutionary techniques to identify approximate relationships between the input and the output. In this research, two general approaches for the evolutionary generation of fuzzy rules are identified and compared: global and local rule generation. Global rule production, which is the standard method of employing evolutionary techniques in fuzzy rule base generation, considers an entire rule base as an element of population. The fitness evaluation of a rule base aggregates the performance of the model over the entire space into a single value. The local approach utilizes the limited scope of a fuzzy rule to evaluate performance in regions of the input space. The local generation of rule bases employs an independent evolutionary search in each region and combines the local results to produce a global model. An experimental suite has been developed to compare the effectiveness of the two strategies for the evolutionary generation of fuzzy models.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,,,,,JUN,2002,32,3,,,,,296,305,PII S1083-4419(02)04347-9,10.1109/TSMCB.2002.999806,0.0,,,,,,,,18238128.0,,,,,WOS:000175449800005,0

However, these approaches do not facilitate the user's task because they require that geometrically precise models of the 3-D environment be given by the user. In this paper, we propose the use of annotations posted on some type of blackboard or descriptive map to facilitate this user-robot interaction. We show that, by using this technique, user commands can be as simple as go to label 5. To build such a mechanism, new approaches for vision-guided mobile robot navigation have to be found. We show that this can be achieved by using mixture models within an appearance-based paradigm. Mixture models are more useful in practice than other pattern recognition methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) or Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA)-also known as linear discriminant analysis (LDA), because they can represent nonlinear subspaces. However, given the fact that mixture models are usually learned using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm which is a gradient ascent technique, the system cannot always converge to a desired final solution, due to the local maxima problem. To resolve this, a genetic version of the EM algorithm is used.

Although the decision regions are partitioned into nonoverlapping subspaces, we can achieve good classification performance since the decision regions can be correctly determined via our proposed fuzzy entropy measure.

The algorithm parameters used to regulate information extraction are explicitly represented as state variables associated with all network nodes. Nodes are also provided with message-passing procedures to represent dependences between parameter settings at adjacent levels. The regulation problem is defined as a joint-probability maximization of a conditional probabilistic measure evaluated over the space of possible configurations of the whole set of state variables (i.e., parameters). The global optimization problem is partitioned and solved in a distributed way, by considering local probabilistic measures for selecting and estimating the parameters related to specific algorithms used within the network. The problem representation allows a spatially varying tuning of parameters, depending on the different informative contents of the subareas of an image. An application of the proposed approach to an image processing problem is described. The professing chain chosen as an example consists of four modules. The first three algorithms correspond to network nodes. The topmost node is devoted to integrating information derived from applying different parameter settings to the algorithms of the chain. The nodes associated with data-transformation processes to be regulated are represented by an optical sensor and two filtering units (for edge-preserving and edge-extracting filterings), and a straight-segment detection module is used as an integration site. Each module is provided with knowledge concerning the parameters to regulate the related processing phase and with specific criteria to estimate data quality. Messages can be bidirectionally propagated among modules in order to search, in a distributed way, for the ''optimum'' set of parameters yielding the best solution.

In particular, the recognition accuracy of current intensity-based FR systems can significantly drop off if the resolution of facial images is smaller than a certain level (e.g., less than 20 x 20 pixels). To cope with low-resolution faces, we demonstrate that facial color cue can significantly improve recognition performance compared with intensity-based features. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, a new metric called variation ratio gain (VRG) is proposed to prove theoretically the significance of color effect on low-resolution faces within well-known subspace FR frameworks; VRG quantitatively characterizes how color features affect the recognition performance with respect to changes in face resolution. Second, we conduct extensive performance evaluation studies to show the effectiveness of color on low-resolution faces. In particular, more than 3000 color facial images of 341 subjects, which are collected from three standard face databases, are used to perform the comparative studies of color effect on face resolutions to be possibly confronted in real-world FR systems. The effectiveness of color on low-resolution faces has successfully been tested on three representative subspace FR methods, including the eigenfaces, the fisherfaces, and the Bayesian.

Under the assumption of affine camera and that the nonrigid object is composed of a rigid part and a deformation part, we propose a stratification approach to recover the structure of nonrigid objects by first reconstructing the structure in affine space and then upgrading it to the Euclidean space. The novelty and main features of the method lies in several aspects. First, we propose a deformation weight constraint to the problem and prove the invariability between the recovered structure and shape bases under this constraint. The constraint was not observed by previous studies. Second, we propose a constrained power factorization algorithm to recover the deformation structure in affine space. The algorithm overcomes some limitations of a previous singular-value-decomposition-based method. It can even work with missing data in the tracking matrix. Third, we propose to separate the rigid features from the deformation ones in 3-D affine space, which makes the detection more accurate and robust. The stratification matrix is estimated from the rigid features, which may relax the influence of large tracking errors in the deformation part.

For localization, binaural cues are extracted using cochleagrams generated by a cochlear model that serve as input to the system. The basic idea of the model is to separately measure interaural time differences and interaural level differences for a number of frequencies and process these measurements as a whole. This leads to two-dimensional frequency versus time-delay representations of binaural cues, so-called activity maps. A probabilistic evaluation is presented to estimate the position of a sound source over time based on these activity maps. Learned reference maps for different azimuthal positions are integrated into the computation to gain time-dependent discrete conditional probabilities. At every timestep these probabilities are combined over frequencies and binaural cues to estimate the sound source position. In addition, they are propagated over time to improve position estimation. This leads to a system that is able to localize audible signals, for example human speech signals, even in reverberating environments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,OCT,2006,36,5,,,,,982,994,,10.1109/TSMCB.2006.872263,0.0,,,,,,,,17036807.0,,,,,WOS:000240756700002,0

Original images g(x, y) are first regularized by using a self-adaptive implementation of the Mumford-Shah functional [24] so that the two parameters a and gamma controlling the smoothness and fidelity, automatically adapt to the local scale and contrast of g(x, y). From the regularized image u(x, y) which is piecewise smooth, it is possible to obtain a piecewise constant image s(N)(x,y) representing a segmentation of the original image g(x, y). Indeed, s(N)(x, y) is the union of N closed regions, having a constant grey level, preserving thin bars and trihedral junctions present in the original image g(x,y). If the number N of closed regions is too high, closed regions can be merged by minimizing a functional which depends on a parameter n. When n is set equal to 1, a coarse segmentation is obtained with a few tens of distinct regions. With larger values of n, finer segmentations are obtained with about a hundred distinct regions. Therefore, by selecting the value of n it is possible to obtain segmentations at different resolutions.

KASER is a creative expert system. It is capable of deductive, inductive, and mixed derivations. Its qualitative creativity is realized by using a tree-search mechanism. The system achieves creative reasoning by using a declarative representation of knowledge consisting of object trees and inheritance. KASER computes with words and phrases. It possesses a capability for metaphor-based explanations. This capability is useful in explaining its creative suggestions and serves to augment the capabilities provided by the explanation subsystems of conventional expert systems. KASER also exhibits an accelerated capability to learn. However, this capability depends on the particulars of the selected application domain. For example, application domains such as the game of chess exhibit a high degree of geometric symmetry. Conversely, application domains such as the game of craps played with two dice exhibit no predictable pattern, unless the dice are loaded. More generally, we say that domains whose informative content can be compressed to a significant degree without loss (or with relatively little loss) are symmetric. Incompressible domains are said to be asymmetric or random.

Uncertainties caused by the roundoff and computational errors subject to FWL effects are expressed in function of mantissa bit number when the mode of floating-point arithmetic is used in the process. Then, based on the Small Gain Theorem and the Bellman-Grownwall Lemma, a sufficient stability criterion for the digital closed-loop system is derived. The eigenvalue sensitivity of the closed-loop system is developed in terms of mixed matrix-2/Frobenius norms. Then, by minimizing this eigenvalue sensitivity and using orthogonal Hermitian transform as well, an optimal similarity transformation can be obtained. By substituting this optimal transformation into the stability criterion, a minimum mantissa bit number used for implementing the stabilizing digital controllers can be determined. The main contributions are that this approach provides an analytical closed-form solution for obtaining the optimal transformation and, in addition to the stability criterion, leads to the implementation of the stabilizing controllers with a lower mantissa bit number when using this optimal one.

The stable and optimal left and right learning rates for the interval neural network, in the sense of maximum error reduction, can be derived for each iteration in the training process (back propagation).

Further, due to variation of the initial MF parameters, i.e., the spread level of uncertain means or deviations of interval Gaussian MFs, the performance of back propagation training process may be affected. To achieve better total performance, a genetic algorithm (GA) is designed to search optimal spread rate for uncertain means and optimal learning for the antecedent part.

In this work, we propose a network model to generate different combinations of the hyperbolic functions to achieve some approximation and classification properties. This is to circumvent the iterative training problem as seen in neural networks learning. In many decision data fusion applications, since individual classifiers or estimators to be combined would have attained a certain level of classification or approximation accuracy, this hyperbolic functions network can be used to combine these classifiers taking their decision outputs as the inputs to the network.

There have been a lot of researches on how to generate or obtain FPRs. There exist two methods to obtain FPRs. One is by painstakingly, repeatedly and time-consuming interviewing domain experts to extract the domain knowledge. The other is by using some machine learning techniques to generate and extract FPRs from some training samples. These extracted rules, however, are found to be nonoptimal and sometimes redundant. Furthermore, these generated rules suffer from the problem of low accuracy of classifying or recognizing unseen examples. The reasons for having these problems are 1) the FPRs generated are not. powerful enough to represent the domain knowledge, 2) the techniques used to generate FPRs are pre-matured, ad-hoc or may not be suitable for the problem, and 3) further refinement of the extracted rules has not been done.

The novelty of this network is that it requires much less computation than that of a MLP. We have shown its effectiveness in the problem of nonlinear dynamic system identification. In presence of additive Gaussian noise to the plant, the performance of the proposed network is found similar or superior to that of a MLP.

In actual project control decisions, PERT has successfully been applied to business management, industry production, project scheduling control, logistics support, etc. However, classical PERT requires a crisp duration time representation for each activity. This requirement is often difficult for the decision-makers due to the fact that they usually can not estimate these values precisely. In recent years, some fuzzy PERT methods have been proposed based on fuzzy set theory for project management. However, there is a drawback in the existing fuzzy PERT methods, i.e., sometimes they maybe cannot rind a critical path in a fuzzy project network.

When surveillance is concerned, complete lane and multiple lane information is essential for tracking vehicles and monitoring lane change frequency from overhead cameras, where traditional methods become inadequate, The algorithm presented in this paper extracts complete multiple lane information by utilizing prominent orientation and length features of lane markings and curb structures to discriminate against other minor features. Essentially, edges are first extracted from the background of a traffic sequence, then thinned and approximated by straight lines, From the resulting set of straight lines, orientation and length discriminations are carried out three-dimensionally with the aid of two-dimensional (2-D) to three-dimensional (3-D) coordinate transformation and K-means clustering, By doing so, edges with strong orientation and length affinity are retained and clustered, while short and isolated edges are eliminated, Overall, the merits of this algorithm are as follows. First, it works well under practical visual surveillance conditions. Second, using K-means for clustering offers a robust approach. Third, the algorithm is efficient as it only requires one image frame to determine the road center lines. Fourth, it computes multiple lane information simultaneously.

In the method of LAM. a model response, nonlinear with respect to the parameters, is approximated linearly by a matrix, which maps inversely from a response vector to a parameter vector, This matrix is determined from a set of initial training parameter vectors and their response vectors according to a given cost function, and can be updated recursively and adaptively with a pair of newly generated parameter response vector. The advantage of LAM is that it can yield good estimation of the true parameter from a given observed response even if the initial training parameter vectors are far from the true values. In a previous paper, we have significantly improved the LAM method by introducing a weighted linear associative memory (WLAM) approach for nonlinear parameter estimation, In the WLAM approach, the contribution of each pair of parameter-response vector to the cost function is weighted in a way such that if a response vector is closer to the observed one then its pair plays more important role in the cost function, However, in both LAM and WLAM, the linear association is introduced with zero interceptions, which would not give an exact association even if the model function is linear and so will affect the efficiency of the estimations, In this paper, we construct a theory which introduces a linear association memory with a nonzero interception (WLAMB).

To tackle the challenges raised by speed change, this paper proposes a higher order shape configuration for gait shape description, which deliberately conserves discriminative information in the gait signatures and is still able to tolerate the varying walking speed. Instead of simply measuring the similarity between two gaits by treating them as two unified objects, a differential composition model (DCM) is constructed. The DCM differentiates the different effects caused by walking speed changes on various human body parts. In the meantime, it also balances well the different discriminabilities of each body part on the overall gait similarity measurements.

In this paper, we propose a formative Semi-Supervised Learning (fSSL) framework which explores hidden features between labeled and unlabeled samples to achieve semi-supervised learning. fSSL regards that both labeled and unlabeled samples are generated from some hidden concepts with labeling information partially observable for some samples. The key of the fSSL is to recover the hidden concepts, and take them as new features to link labeled and unlabeled samples for semi-supervised learning. Because unlabeled samples are only used to generate new features, but not to be explicitly included in the training set like pSSL does, fSSL overcomes the inherent disadvantages of the traditional pSSL methods, especially for samples not within the same domain as the labeled instances.

One major drawback with this approach is that data observations are mapped to HMMs without considering the number of data samples available. Another problem is that this approach is only useful for choosing between HMMs. It does not provide a criterion for determining whether or not a given HMM adequately matches the data stream.

The type-1 fuzzy inference systems (FISs) with fuzzy functions, which do not entail if ... then rule bases, have demonstrated better performance compared to traditional FIS. Nonetheless, the performance of these approaches is usually affected by their uncertain parameters. The proposed method implements a three-phase learning strategy to capture the uncertainties in fuzzy function systems induced by learning parameters, as well as fuzzy function structures. The improved fuzzy clustering initially finds hidden structures, and the genetic learning algorithm optimizes interval type-2 fuzzy sets to capture their optimum uncertainty interval. The proposed ET2FF architecture is evaluated using an extensive suite of real-life applications such as manufacturing process and financial market modeling. The results show that the proposed ET2FF method is comparable-if not superior-to earlier FIS in terms of generalization performance and robustness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,AUG,2008,38,4,,,,,1098,1110,,10.1109/TSMCB.2008.924587,0.0,,,,,,,,18632400.0,,,,,WOS:000258183100027,0

These two methods will be first analyzed in detail by using sensitivity analysis on the outputs of the OWA with respect to the optimism degree of the decision maker, and then the two methods will be compared. The fuzzy linguistic quantifiers approach gives more information about the behavior of the OWA outputs in comparison to the minimal variability method. However, in using the minimal variability method, the OWA has a linear behavior with respect to the optimism degree, and, therefore, it has better computation efficiency.

The main difficulty in developing the incremental LDA (ILDA) is to handle the inverse of the within-class scatter matrix. In this paper, based on the generalized singular value decomposition LDA (LDA/GSVD), we develop a new ILDA algorithm called GSVD-ILDA. Different from the existing techniques in which the new projection matrix is found in a restricted subspace, the proposed GSVD-ILDA determines the projection matrix in full space. Extensive experiments are performed to compare the proposed GSVD-ILDA with the LDA/GSVD as well as the existing ILDA methods using the face recognition technology face database and the Carneggie Mellon University Pose, Illumination, and Expression face database.

However, because conventional iris cameras have small depth-of-field (DOF) areas, input iris images can easily be blurred, which can lead to lower recognition performance, since iris patterns are transformed by the blurring caused by optical defocusing. To overcome these problems, an autofocusing camera can be used. However, this inevitably increases the cost, size, and complexity of the system. Therefore, we propose a new real-time iris image-restoration method, which can increase the camera's DOF without requiring any additional hardware. This paper presents five novelties as compared to previous works: 1) by excluding eyelash and eyelid regions, it is possible to obtain more accurate focus scores from input iris images; 2) the parameter of the point spread function (PSF) can be estimated in terms of camera optics and measured focus scores; therefore, parameter estimation is more accurate than it has been in previous research; 3) because the PSF parameter can be-obtained by using a predetermined equation, iris image restoration can be done in real-time; 4) by using a constrained least square (CLS) restoration filter that considers noise, performance can be greatly enhanced; and 5) restoration accuracy can also be enhanced by estimating the weight value of the noise-regularization term of the CLS filter according to the amount of image blurring. Experimental results showed that iris recognition errors when using the proposed restoration method were greatly reduced as compared to those results achieved without restoration or those achieved using previous iris-restoration methods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,DEC,2007,37,6,,,,,1555,1566,,10.1109/TSMCB.2007.907042,0.0,,,,,,,,18179073.0,,,,,WOS:000251110300010,0

In the proposed PSO-based MA (PSOMA), both PSO-based searching operators and some special local searching operators are designed to balance the exploration and exploitation abilities. In particular, the PSOMA applies the evolutionary searching mechanism of PSO, which is characterized by individual improvement, population cooperation, and competition to effectively perform exploration. On the other hand, the PSOMA utilizes several adaptive local searches to perform exploitation. First, to make PSO suitable for solving PFSSP, a ranked-order value rule based on random key representation is presented to convert the continuous position values of particles to job permutations. Second, to generate an initial swarm with certain quality and diversity, the famous Nawaz-Enscore-Ham (NEH) heuristic is incorporated into the initialization of population. Third, to balance the exploration and exploitation abilities, after the standard PSO-based searching operation, a new local search technique named NEH_1 insertion is probabilistically applied to some good particles selected by using a roulette wheel mechanism with a specified probability. Fourth, to enrich the searching behaviors and to avoid premature convergence, a simulated annealing (SA)-based local search with multiple different neighborhoods is designed and incorporated into the PSOMA. Meanwhile, an effective adaptive meta-Lamarckian learning strategy is employed to decide which neighborhood to be used in SA-based local search. Finally, to further enhance the exploitation ability, a pairwise-based local search is applied after the SA-based search.

Recently, PCA has been extensively employed for face-recognition algorithms, such as eigenface and fisherface. The encouraging results have been reported and discussed in the literature. Many PCA-based face-recognition systems have also been developed in the last decade. However, existing PCA-based face-recognition systems are hard to scale up because of the computational cost and memory-requirement burden. To overcome this limitation, an incremental approach is usually adopted. Incremental PCA (IPCA) methods have been studied for many years in the machine-learning community. The major limitation of existing IPCA methods is that there is no guarantee on the approximation error. In view of this limitation, this paper proposes a new IPCA method based on the idea of a singular value decomposition (SVD) updating algorithm, namely an SVD updating-based IPCA (SVDU-IPCA) algorithm. In the proposed SVDU-IPCA algorithm, we have mathematically proved that the approximation error is bounded. A complexity analysis on the proposed method is also presented. Another characteristic of the proposed SVDU-IPCA algorithm is that it can be easily extended to a kernel version. The proposed method has been evaluated using available public databases, namely FERET, AR, and Yale B, and applied to existing face-recognition algorithms. Experimental results show that the difference of the average recognition accuracy between the proposed incremental method and the batch-mode method is less than 1%.

In all cases, there needs to be an underlying data mining system, and this mining system must be highly scalable. To this end, we describe a new rule learner called DataSqueezer. The learner belongs to the family of inductive supervised rule extraction algorithms. DataSqueezer is a simple, greedy, rule builder that generates a set of production rules from labeled input data. In spite of its relative simplicity, DataSqueezer is a very effective learner. The rules generated by the algorithm are compact, comprehensible, and have accuracy comparable to rules generated by other state-of-the-art rule extraction algorithms. The main advantages of DataSqueezer are very high efficiency, and missing data resistance.

That is, appropriate input features of the classifier must be selected from a given (and often large) set of possible features and structure parameters of the classifier must be adapted with respect to these features and a given data set. This paper describes an evolutionary algorithm (EA) that performs feature and model selection simultaneously for radial, basis function (RBF) classifiers. In order to reduce the optimization effort, various techniques are integrated that accelerate and improve the EA significantly: hybrid training of RBF networks, lazy evaluation consideration of soft constraints by means of penalty terms, and temperature-based adaptive control of the EA. The feasibility and the benefits of the approach are demonstrated by means of four data mining problems: intrusion detection in computer networks, biometric signature verification, customer acquisition with direct marketing methods, and optimization of chemical production processes. It is shown that, compared to earlier EA-based RBF optimization techniques, the runtime is reduced by up to 99% while error rates are lowered by up to 86%, depending on the application. The algorithm is independent of specific applications so that many ideas and solutions can be transferred to other classifier paradigms.",,,,,,"Sick, Bernhard/0000-0001-9467-656X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,OCT,2005,35,5,,,,,928,947,,10.1109/TSMCB.2005.847743,0.0,,,,,,,,16240769.0,,,,,WOS:000232384200007,0

Step edges are computed by extracting local maxima from the energy summed over a large bank of directional odd filters with a different scale. Thin roof edges are computed by considering maxima of the energy summed over narrow odd and even filters along the direction providing maximal response. Junctions are precisely detected and recovered using the output of directional filters. The proposed algorithm has a threshold for the minimum contrast of detected edges: for the large number of tested images this threshold was fixed equal to three times the standard deviation of the noise present in usual acquisition system (estimated to be between 1 and 1.3 gray levels out of 256), therefore, the proposed scheme is in fact parameter free. This scheme for edge detection performs better than the classical Canny edge detector in two quantitative comparisons: the recovery of the original image from the edge map and the structure from motion task.

One strategy for solving these types of problems is to learn the input-output functionality from examples in a training set. However, in many situations it is difficult to know what information is relevant to the task at hand. Subsequently, researchers have investigated ways to deal with the so-called problem of consistency of attributes, i.e., attributes that can distinguish examples from different classes. In this paper, we first prove that the notion of relevance of attributes is directly related to the consistency of attributes, and show how relevant, irredundant attributes can be selected. We then compare different relevant attribute selection algorithms, and show the superiority of algorithms that select irredundant attributes over those that select relevant attributes. We also show that searching for an optimal subset of attributes, which is considered to be the main purpose of attribute selection, is not the best way to improve the accuracy of classifiers. Employing sets of relevant, irredundant attributes improves classification accuracy in many more cases. Finally, we propose a new method for selecting relevant examples, which is based on filtering the so-called pattern frequency domain. By identifying examples that are nontypical in the determination of relevant, irredundant attributes, irrelevant examples can be eliminated prior to the learning process. Empirical results using artificial and real databases show the effectiveness of the proposed method in selecting relevant examples leading to improved performance even on greatly reduced training sets.",,,,,"Anthony, Laurence/ABE-6103-2021","Anthony, Laurence/0000-0002-8249-2824",,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,APR,2004,34,2,,,,,888,897,,10.1109/TSMCB.2003.817106,0.0,,,,,,,,15376837.0,,,,,WOS:000220359900007,0

However, such methods have been proven to be inefficient at times in coping with varying and conflicting bandwidth requirements of the different services in ATM networks. This inefficiency is due to the computational complexity of the model. To overcome this difficulty, many approximation-based solutions, such as the fluid flow approximation technique, were introduced. Although such solutions are simple, in terms of computational complexity, they nevertheless suffer from potential inaccuracies in estimating the required bandwidth. Soft computing-based bandwidth controllers, such as neural networks- and neurofuzzy-based controllers, have been shown to effectively solve an indeterminate nonlinear input-output (I-O) relations by learning from examples.

Our network-based model provides an effective and efficient reasoning procedure to perform prediction and decision making. Unlike many existing paradigms based on linear models, the attribute relationship in our framework is represented by nonlinear nonnegative multiregressions based on the Choquet integral. This kind of multiregression is able to model a rich set of nonlinear interactions directly. Our framework involves two layers. The outer layer is a network structure consisting of network elements as its components, while the inner layer is concerned with a particular network element modeled by Choquet integrals. We develop a fast double optimization algorithm (FDOA) for learning the multiregression coefficients of a single network element. Using this local learning component and multiregression-residual-cost evolutionary programming (MRCEP), we propose a global learning algorithm, called MRCEP-FDOA, for discovering the network structures and their elements from databases.

We justify that one should start with separate clustering of X (input) and Y (output). We propose a scheme to establish correspondence between the clusters obtained in X and Y. The correspondence dictates whether further splitting/merging of clusters is needed or not. If X and Y do not exhibit strong cluster substructures, then again clustering of X* (input data augmented by the output data) exploiting the results of separate clustering of X and Y, and of the correspondence scheme is recommended. We justify that usual cluster validity indices are not suitable for finding the number of rules, and the proposed scheme does not use any cluster validity index.

In this paper, we study dynamic coevolution between individual rational strategies ( cooperative or defect) and the overlay network structure, that is, the interaction between peer's local rational behaviors and the emergence of the whole network structure. We propose an evolutionary game theory (EGT)-based overlay topology evolution scheme to drive a given overlay into the small-world structure ( high global network efficiency and average clustering coefficient). Our contributions are the following threefold: From the viewpoint of peers' local interactions, we explicitly consider the peer's rational behavior and introduce a link-formation game to characterize the social dilemma of forming links in an overlay network. Furthermore, in the evolutionary link-formation phase, we adopt a simple economic process: Each peer keeps one link to a cooperative neighbor in its neighborhood, which can slightly speed up the convergence of cooperation and increase network efficiency; from the viewpoint of the whole network structure, our simulation results show that the EGT-based scheme can drive an arbitrary overlay network into a fully cooperative and efficient small-world structure. Moreover, we compare our scheme with a search-based economic model of network formation and illustrate that our scheme can achieve the experimental and analytical results in the latter model. In addition, we also graphically illustrate the final overlay network structure; finally, based on the group selection model and evolutionary set theory, we theoretically obtain the approximate threshold of cost and draw the conclusion that the small value of the average degree and the large number of the total peers in an overlay network facilitate the evolution of cooperation.",,,,,,"Nakao, Akihiro/0000-0003-0012-5287",,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,APR,2010,40,2,,,,,493,504,,10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2027221,0.0,,,,,,,,19726264.0,,,,,WOS:000275665300018,0

The prior art has improved the available solutions to the MAT by incorporating proximity information, and this approach is done by recursively reducing the size of the data set by excluding points that are farthest from the centroid and points that are closest to these farthest points. Thus, although the method is extremely effective, arguably, it uses only the proximity information while ignoring the mutual interaction between the records. In this paper, we argue that interrecord relationships can be quantified in terms of the following two entities: 1) their association and 2) their interaction. This case means that records that are not necessarily close to each other may still be grouped, because their mutual interaction, which is quantified by invoking transitive-closure-like operations on the latter entity, could be significant, as suggested by the theoretically sound principles of NNs. By repeatedly invoking the interrecord associations and interactions, the records are grouped into sizes of cardinality k, where k is the security parameter in the algorithm. Our experimental results, which are done on artificial data and benchmark real-life data sets, demonstrate that the newly proposed method is superior to the state of the art not only based on the Information Loss (IL) perspective but also when it concerns a criterion that involves a combination of the IL and the Disclosure Risk (DR).",,,,,"Oommen, B.

The novelty of our hybrid algorithm (CEL-EM) is that it is applicable for estimation of the constraint-based models with many constraints and large numbers of parameters (which use EM) like HMM. Two constraint-based versions of the CEL-EM with different fusion strategies have been proposed using a constraint-based EA and the EM for better estimation of HMM in ASR. The first one uses a traditional constraint-handling mechanism of EA. The other version transforms a constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained problem using Lagrange multipliers. Fusion strategies for the CEL-EM use a staged-fusion approach where EM has been plugged with the EA periodically after the execution of EA for a specific period of time to maintain the global sampling capabilities of EA in the hybrid algorithm. A variable initialization approach (VIA) has been proposed using a variable segmentation to provide a better initialization for EA in the CEL-EM.

The eye model used considers the offset between optical and visual axes, the refraction of the cornea, and Donder's law. This paper demonstrates the minimal number of cameras, light sources, and user calibration points needed to solve for gaze estimation. The underlying geometric model is based on glint positions and pupil ellipse in the image, and the minimal hardware needed for this model is one camera and multiple light-emitting diodes. This paper proves that subject calibration is compulsory for correct gaze estimation and proposes a model based on a single point for subject calibration.

Numerous variants, such as the kernel-based Fisher discriminant analysis (KFDA), have been proposed to enhance the LDA's power for nonlinear discriminants. Although effective, the KFDA is computationally expensive, since the complexity increases with the size of the data set. In this correspondence, we suggest a novel strategy to enhance the computation for an entire family of the KFDAs. Rather than invoke the KFDA for the entire data set, we advocate that the data be first reduced into a smaller representative subset using a prototype reduction scheme and that the dimensionality reduction be achieved by invoking a KFDA on this reduced data set. In this way, data points that are ineffective in the dimension reduction and classification can be eliminated to obtain a significantly reduced kernel matrix K without degrading the performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism dramatically reduces the computation time without sacrificing the classification accuracy for artificial and real-life data sets.",,,,,"Oommen, B.

To shape the response of the closed-loop system, a set of fuzzy reference models is established. Similarly, the same fuzzy sets of the system rule are employed to design a fuzzy neural-based control. The proposed control contains a radial-basis function neural network to learn the uncertainties caused by the approximation error of the fuzzy model (e.g., time-varying delays and parameter variations) and the interactions resulting from the other subsystems. As the norm of the switching surface is inside of a defined set, the learning law starts; in this situation, the proposed method is an adaptive control possessing an extra compensation of uncertainties. As it is outside of the other set, which is smaller than the aforementioned set, the learning law stops; under this circumstance, the proposed method becomes a robust control without the compensation of uncertainties. A transition between robust control and adaptive control is also assigned to smooth the possible discontinuity of the control input. No assumption about the upper bound of the time-varying delays for the state and the input is required. However, two time-average delays are needed to simplify the controller design: 1) the stabilized conditions for every transformed delay-free subsystem must be satisfied; and 2) the learning uncertainties must be relatively bounded. The stability of the overall system is verified by Lyapunov stability theory. Simulations as compared with a linear transformed state feedback with integration control are also arranged to consolidate the usefulness of the proposed control.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,,,,,DEC,2007,37,6,,,,,1471,1485,,10.1109/TSMCB.2007.903448,0.0,,,,,,,,18179067.0,,,,,WOS:000251110300004,0

Consequently, CONN is composed of a constructive part, which grows the tour and an optimizer part to optimize it. In the training algorithm, an initial tour is created first and introduced to CONN. Then, it is trained in the constructive phase for adding a number of cities to the tour. Next, the training algorithm switches to the optimizer phase for optimizing the current tour by displacing the tour cities. After convergence in this phase, the training. algorithm switches to the constructive phase anew and is continued until all cities are added to the tour. Furthermore, we investigate a relationship between the number of TSP cities and the number of cities to be added in each constructive phase. CONN was tested on nine sets of benchmark TSPs from TSPLIB to demonstrate its performance and efficiency. It performed better than several typical Neural networks (NNs), including KNIES_TSP_Local, KNIES_TSP_Global, Budinich's SOM, Co-Adaptive Net, and multivalued Hopfield network as wall as computationally comparable variants of the simulated annealing algorithm, in terms of both CPU time and accuracy. Furthermore, CONN converged considerably faster than expanding SOM and evolved integrated SOM and generated shorter tours compared to KNIES_DECOMPOSE.

The experimental results demonstrate that the reconstruction performance of SOTT is comparable to the full-search SOM and its computation time is much shorter than the full-search SOM and other vector quantizers. In addition, SOTT delivers the hierarchical mapping of codevectors and the progressive transmission and decoding property, which are rarely supported by other vector quantizers at the same time. To circumvent the shortcomings of clustering performance of classical partition clustering algorithms, a hybrid clustering algorithm that fully exploit the online learning and multiresolution characteristics of SOTT is devised. A new linkage metric is proposed which can be updated online to accelerate the time consuming agglomerative hierarchical clustering stage.

By generality, we mean a dynamic simulator which can easily support various systems of rigid bodies, ranging from a single free-flying rigid object to complex linkages such as those needed for robotic systems or human body simulation. To provide this generality, we have developed I-GMS in an object-oriented framework. The user interactivity is supported through a haptic interface for articulated bodies, introducing interactive dynamic simulation schemes. This user-interaction is achieved by performing push and pull operations via the PHANToM haptic device, which runs as an integrated part of I-GMS. Also, a hybrid scheme was used for simulating internal contacts (between bodies in the multirigid-body system) in the presence of friction, which could avoid the nonexistent solution problem often faced when solving contact problems with Coulomb friction. In our hybrid scheme, two impulse-based methods are exploited so that different methods are applied adaptively, depending on whether the current contact situation is characterized as bouncing or steady.

However, the deadline driven scheme is computationally complex and hard to implement in hardware. The mixed scheduling algorithm is the combination of the rate monotonic algorithm and the deadline driven algorithm; thus it can provide most of the benefits of these two algorithms.

The proposed system comprises a model-based fuzzy logic controller, an arterial tonometer and a micro syringe device. The flexible diaphragm tonometer is to register the continuous blood pressure waveform. To obtain accurate measurement without distortion, the tonometer's mean chamber pressure must be kept equal to the mean arterial pressure (MAP), the so-called optimal coupling condition, such that the arterial vessel has the maximum compliance. Since the MAP cannot be measured directly, to keep the optimal coupling condition becomes a tracking control problem with unknown desired trajectory. To solve this dilemma, a model-based fuzzy logic controller is designed to compensate the change of MAP by applying a counter pressure on the tonometer chamber through the micro syringe device. The proposed controller consists of a model-based predictor and a synthetic fuzzy logic controller (SFLC). The model-based predictor is to estimate the MAPs changing tendency based on the identified arterial pressure-volume model. The SFLC is composed of three subcontrollers, each of which is a simple fuzzy logic controller, for processing the three changing states of the MAP: ascending, descending and stabilizing states, respectively.

In the context of information entropy, we show that performance of GCS in learning topology and vector quantization can be optimized by using alpha = 0 incorporated with a threshold-free node-removal scheme, regardless of input data being stationary or nonstationary. The meaning of optimization is twofold: 1) for learning topology, the information entropy is maximized in terms of equiprobable criterion and 2) for Learning vector quantization, the mse is minimized in terms of equi-error criterion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,,,,,AUG,2000,30,4,,,,,586,593,,10.1109/3477.865177,0.0,,,,,,,,18252390.0,,,,,WOS:000089118000010,0

In this paper we present a two-stage evolutionary process for designing TSK fuzzy rule-based systems from examples combining a generation stage based on a (mu, lambda)-evolution strategy, in which the fuzzy rules with different consequents compete among themselves to form part of a preliminary knowledge base, and a refinement stage, in which both the antecedent and consequent parts of the fuzzy rules in this previous knowledge base are adapted by a hybrid evolutionary process composed of a genetic algorithm and an evolution strategy to obtain the final Knowledge Base whose rules cooperate in the best possible way. Some aspects make this process different from others proposed until now: the design problem is addressed in two different stages, the use of an angular coding of the consequent parameters that allows us to search across the whole space of possible solutions, and the use of the available knowledge about the system under identification to generate the initial populations of the Evolutionary Algorithms that causes the search process to obtain good solutions more quickly, The performance of the method proposed is shown by solving two different problems: the fuzzy modeling of some three-dimensional surfaces and the computing of the maintenance costs of electrical medium line in Spanish towns.

Our method works by associating meanings to words in manipulation tasks, as a robot interacts with objects and listens to verbal descriptions of the interactions. The model is based on an affordance network, i.e., a mapping between robot actions, robot perceptions, and the perceived effects of these actions upon objects. We extend the affordance model to incorporate spoken words, which allows us to ground the verbal symbols to the execution of actions and the perception of the environment. The model takes verbal descriptions of a task as the input and uses temporal co-occurrence to create links between speech utterances and the involved objects, actions, and effects. We show that the robot is able form useful word-to-meaning associations, even without considering grammatical structure in the learning process and in the presence of recognition errors. These word-to-meaning associations are embedded in the robot's own understanding of its actions. Thus, they can be directly used to instruct the robot to perform tasks and also allow to incorporate context in the speech recognition task.

Several recent works in this area concern strategies for the development of FCMs. Although a few fully automated algorithms to learn these models from data have been introduced, the resulting FCMs are structurally considerably different than those developed by human experts. In particular, maps that were learned from data are much denser (with the density over 90% versus about 40% density of maps developed by humans). The sparseness of the maps is associated with their interpretability: the smaller the number of connections is, the higher is the transparency of the map. To this end, a novel learning approach, sparse real-coded genetic algorithms (SRCGAs), to learn FCMs is proposed. The method utilizes a density parameter to guide the learning toward a formation of maps of a certain predefined density. Comparative tests carried out for both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that, given a suitable density estimate, the SRCGA method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art learning methods. When the density estimate is unknown, the new method can be used in an automated fashion using a default value, and it is still able to produce models whose performance exceeds or is equal to the performance of the models generated by other methods.",,,,,"Kurgan, Lukasz/B-5721-2009","Kurgan, Lukasz/0000-0002-7749-0314",,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,JUN,2012,42,3,,,,,900,912,,10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2182646,0.0,,,,,,,,22345544.0,,,,,WOS:000304163200026,0

Value of information (VOI) is a well-known scheme for selecting measurements, but the intractability of the problem typically leads to using myopic VOI estimates.

Using a LoD-driven genetic algorithm, HAW optimally weights the intrinsic modes of the acquired signals, preparing them for sample entropy (SampEn) estimation that follows. The resulting feature set, namely, weighted intrinsic-mode entropy (IMEn) (wIMEn), aims at increasing the SL-sign-classification accuracy alone or boosted by signer identification and/or signer's LoD-based group identification. The wIMEn was compared with three other feature sets, i.e., time frequency, SampEn, and IMEn, regarding their discrimination ability (both among signers and SL signs). Data from the dominant hand of nine subjects with various LoD were analyzed for the classification of 61 Greek SL (GSL) signs. Experimental results have shown that the introduced wIMEn feature set exhibited higher performance compared to others, both in signer identification and signer's LoD-based group identification and in GSL sign classification.

As such, the temporal dependencies are eliminated and the whole video sequence is represented by a few coefficients. The linear separability of the extracted features is assessed, and its suitability for both parametric and nonparametric classification techniques is elaborated upon. The proposed feature-extraction scheme was complemented by simple classification techniques, namely, K nearest neighbor (KNN) and Bayesian, i.e., likelihood ratio, classifiers. Experimental results showed classification performance ranging from 97% to 100% recognition rates. To validate our proposed technique, we have conducted a series of experiments using the classical way of classifying data with temporal dependencies, namely, hidden Markov models (HMMs). Experimental results revealed that the proposed feature-extraction scheme combined with simple KNN or Bayesian classification yields comparable results to the classical HMM-based scheme. Moreover, since the proposed scheme compresses the motion information of an image sequence into a single image, it allows for using simple classification techniques where the temporal dimension is eliminated.

This paper proposes a new evolutionary algorithm that fulfills such requirements and solves fuzzy modeling problems. Two major ideas proposed in this paper lie in a new encoding scheme and a new fitness function, respectively. The proposed encoding scheme consists of three chromosomes, one of which uses unique chained possibilistic representation of rule structure. The proposed encoding scheme can achieve simultaneous optimization of parameters of antecedent membership functions and rule structures with the new fitness function developed in this paper. The proposed fitness function consists of five functions that consider three evaluation criteria in fuzzy modeling problems. The proposed fitness function guides evolutionary search direction so that the proposed algorithm can find more accurate compact fuzzy models with interpretable antecedent membership functions. Several evolutionary operators that are appropriate for the proposed encoding scheme are carefully designed. Simulation results on three modeling problems show that the proposed encoding scheme and the proposed fitness functions are effective in finding accurate, compact, and interpretable Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy models. From the simulation results, it is shown that the proposed algorithm can successfully find fuzzy models that approximate the given unknown function accurately with a compact number of fuzzy rules and membership functions.

By introducing the augmented system which consists of the switching fuzzy model and a stable linear system, the controller design conditions based on the switching Lyapunov function are given in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Therefore, we can effectively design the switching fuzzy controller via LMI-based approach. A design example illustrates the utility of this approach.

This new evolutionary learning algorithm is based on a hybrid of genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), and is thus called HGAPSO. In HGAPSO, individuals in a new generation are created, not only by crossover and mutation operation as in GA, but also by PSO. The concept of elite strategy is adopted in HGAPSO, where the upper-half of the best-performing individuals in a population are regarded as elites. However, instead of being reproduced directly to the next generation, these elites are first enhanced. The group constituted by the elites is regarded as a swarm, and each elite corresponds to a particle within it. In this regard, the elites are enhanced by PSO, an operation which mimics the maturing phenomenon in nature. These enhanced elites constitute half of the population in the new generation, whereas the other half is generated by performing crossover and mutation operation on these enhanced elites. HGAPSO is applied to recurrent neural/fuzzy network design as follows. For recurrent neural network, a fully connected recurrent neural network is designed and applied to a temporal sequence production problem.

However, it is difficult to maintain the correctness, consistency, and completeness of a fuzzy rule base constructed and tuned by a human expert. Reinforcement learning method is capable of learning the fuzzy rules automatically. However, it incurs heavy learning phase and may result in an insufficiently learned rule base due to the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a neural fuzzy system with mixed coarse learning and fine learning phases. In the first phase, supervised learning method is used to determine the membership functions for the input and output variables simultaneously. After sufficient training, fine learning is applied which employs reinforcement learning algorithm to fine-tune the membership functions for the output variables. For sufficient learning, a new learning method using modified Sutton and Barto's model is proposed to strengthen the exploration. Through this two-step tuning approach, the mobile robot is able to perform collision-free navigation. To deal with the difficulty in acquiring large amount of training data with high consistency for the supervised learning, we develop a virtual environment (VE) simulator, which is able to provide desktop virtual environment (DVE) and immersive virtual environment (IVE) visualization.

Some pairs of samples called as mutual pairs, which have a tendency to gravitate toward each other, are discerned at each stage of this multistage scheme. The notions of cluster coglomerate strength and global coglomerate strength are used for accomplishing or abandoning the process of merging a mutual pair. The methodology forms composite symbolic objects whenever two symbolic objects are merged. The process of merging at each stage, reduces the number of samples that are available for consideration, The procedure terminates at some stage where there are no more mutual pairs available for merging.

As part of the segmentation process, the separation of clusters of partially occluded chromosomes, which is the critical stage that state-of-the-art chromosome analyzers usually fail to accomplish, is performed. First, a moment representation of the image pixels is clustered to create a binary image without a need for threshold selection. Based on the binary image, lines connecting cut points imply possible separations. These hypotheses are verified by a multilayer percept on (MLP) NN that classifies the two segments created by each separating line. Use of a classification-driven segmentation process gives very promising results without a need for shape modeling or an excessive use of heuristics. In addition, an NN implementation of Sammon's mapping using principal component based initialization is applied to feature extraction, significantly reducing the dimensionality of the feature space and allowing high classification capability. Finally, by applying MLP based hierarchical classification strategies to a well-explored chromosome database, we achieve a classification performance of 83.6%.

Since its inception in the mid 1990s, DE has been finding many successful applications in real-world optimization problems from diverse domains of science and engineering. This paper takes a first significant step toward the convergence analysis of a canonical DE (DE/rand/1/bin) algorithm. It first deduces a time-recursive relationship for the probability density function (PDF) of the trial solutions, taking into consideration the DE-type mutation, crossover, and selection mechanisms. Then, by applying the concepts of Lyapunov stability theorems, it shows that as time approaches infinity, the PDF of the trial solutions concentrates narrowly around the global optimum of the objective function, assuming the shape of a Dirac delta distribution. Asymptotic convergence behavior of the population PDF is established by constructing a Lyapunov functional based on the PDF and showing that it monotonically decreases with time. The analysis is applicable to a class of continuous and real-valued objective functions that possesses a unique global optimum (but may have multiple local optima).

The proposed spatial Markov chain model can be trained via maximum-likelihood estimation and then be used directly for image categorization. Since this is completely a generative method, we can further improve it through developing new discriminative learning. Hence, spatial dependence between visual keywords is incorporated into kernels in two different ways, for use with a support vector machine in a discriminative approach to the image categorization problem. Moreover, a kernel combination is used to handle rotation and multiscale issues.

Over the years, this assumption has been eroded by the emergence of users that alter network behavior in a way to benefit themselves at the expense of others. At one extreme, a malicious user/node may eavesdrop on sensitive data or deliberately inject packets into the network to disrupt network operations. The solution to this generally lies in encryption and authentication. In contrast, a rational node acts only to achieve an outcome that he desires most. In such a case, cooperation is still achievable if the outcome is to the best interest of the node. The node misbehavior problem would be more pronounced in multihop wireless networks like mobile ad hoc and sensor networks, which are typically made up of wireless battery-powered devices that must cooperate to forward packets for one another. However, cooperation may be hard to maintain as it consumes scarce resources such as bandwidth, computational power, and battery power. This paper applies game theory to achieve collusive networking behavior in such network environments. In this paper, pricing, promiscuous listening, and mass punishments are avoided altogether. Our model builds on recent work in the field of Economics on the theory of imperfect private monitoring for the dynamic Bertrand oligopoly, and adapts it to the wireless multihop network. The model derives conditions for collusive packet forwarding, truthful routing broadcasts, and packet acknowledgments under a lossy wireless multihop environment, thus capturing many important characteristics of the network layer and link layer in one integrated analysis that has not been achieved previously. We also provide a proof of the viability of the model under a theoretical wireless environment.

Given that resource providers and consumers may have different requirements, successfully obtaining commitments through concurrent negotiations with multiple resource providers to simultaneously access several resources is a very challenging task for consumers. The impetus of this paper is that it is one of the earliest works that consider a concurrent negotiation mechanism for Grid resource coallocation. The concurrent negotiation mechanism is designed for 1) managing (de) commitment of contracts through one-to-many negotiations and 2) coordination of multiple concurrent one-to-many negotiations between a consumer and multiple resource providers. The novel contributions of this paper are devising 1) a utility-oriented coordination (UOC) strategy, 2) three classes of commitment management strategies (CMSs) for concurrent negotiation, and 3) the negotiation protocols of consumers and providers. Implementing these ideas in a testbed, three series of experiments were carried out in a variety of settings to compare the following: 1) the CMSs in this paper with the work of others in a single one-to-many negotiation environment for one resource where decommitment is allowed for both provider and consumer agents; 2) the performance of the three classes of CMSs in different resource market types; and 3) the UOC strategy with the work of others [e.g., the patient coordination strategy (PCS)] for coordinating multiple concurrent negotiations. Empirical results show the following: 1) the UOC strategy achieved higher utility, faster negotiation speed, and higher success rates than PCS for different resource market types; and 2) the CMS in this paper achieved higher final utility than the CMS in other works.

These functions construct the surface on which swarm members travel, controlling the overall swarm geometry and the individual member spacing. Nonlinear limiting functions are defined to provide tighter swarm control by modifying and adjusting a set of control variables that force the swarm to behave according to set constraints, formation, and member spacing. The artificial potential functions and limiting functions are combined to control swarm formation, orientation, and swarm movement as a whole. Parameters are chosen based on desired formation and user-defined constraints. This approach is computationally efficient and scales well to different swarm sizes, to heterogeneous systems, and to both centralized and decentralized swarm models.

The Gabor wavelet transform, however, introduces very high dimensional data. To reduce this dimensionality, uniform sampling of Gabor features has traditionally been used. Since uniform sampling equally treats all the features, it can lead to a loss of important features while retaining trivial ones. In this paper, we propose a new face representation method that employs nonuniform multilevel selection of Gabor features. The proposed method is based on the local statistics of the Gabor features and is implemented using a coarse-to-fine hierarchical strategy. Gabor features that correspond to important face regions are automatically selected and sampled finer than other features. The nonuniformly extracted Gabor features are then classified using principal component analysis and/or linear discriminant analysis for the purpose of face recognition. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments have been conducted on benchmark face image databases where the images vary in illumination, expression, pose, and scale. Compared with the methods that use the original gray-scale image with 4096-dimensional data and uniform sampling with 2560-dimensional data, the proposed method results in a significantly higher recognition rate, with a substantial lower dimension of around 700. The experimental results also show that the proposed method works well not only when multiple sample images are available for training but also when only one sample image is available for each person.

To effectively arrive at meaningful solutions in a vast array of problem-solving tasks, it becomes imperative to establish a sound machinery of reconciling findings which might form partial solutions to an overall problem. In this paper, we focus on a broad category of problems of collaborative data analysis realized by a collection of agents having access to their individual data and exchanging findings through their collaboration activities. Such problems of data analysis arise in the context of building a global view at a certain phenomenon (process) by viewing it from different perspectives (and thus engaging various collections of attributes by various agents). Our goal is to develop some interaction between the agents so that they could form an overall perspective, where the knowledge available locally is shared and reconciled. The underlying format of knowledge built by the agents is that of information granules and fuzzy sets in particular. We develop a comprehensive optimization scheme and discuss its two-phase nature in which the communication phase of the granular findings intertwines with the local optimization being realized by the agents at the level of the individual datasite and exploits the evidence collected from other sites. We show how the mechanism of fuzzy granulation realized in the form of a well-known fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering can be augmented to support collaborative activities required by the agents. For this purpose, we introduce augmented versions of the original objective function used in the FCM and derive algorithmic details.

At the heart of the scheme, a team of deterministic LA performs a controlled random walk on a discretized solution space. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the discretization resolution determines the precision of the scheme, and that for a given precision, the current solution (to both problems) is consistently improved until a nearly optimal solution is found-even for switching environments.

More specifically, unlike the traditional LA model in which LA attempts to learn the optimal action offered by the Environment (also here called the Oracle), this paper considers the problem of the learning mechanism (robot, an LA, or in general, an algorithm) attempting to learn a parameter within a closed interval. The problem is modeled as follows: The learning mechanism is trying to locate an unknown point on a real interval by interacting with a stochastic Environment through a series of informed guesses. For each guess, the Environment essentially informs the mechanism, possibly erroneously (i.e., with probability p), which way it should move to reach the unknown point. When the probability of a correct response is p > 0.5, the Environment is said to be informative, and thus the case of learning from a stochastic teacher. When this probability p < 0.5, the Environment is deemed deceptive, and is called a stochastic compulsive liar. This paper describes a novel learning strategy by which the unknown parameter can be learned in both environments. These results are the first reported results, which are applicable to the latter scenario. The most significant contribution of this paper is that the proposed scheme is shown to operate equally well, even when the learning mechanism is unaware of whether the Environment (Oracle) is informative or deceptive. The learning strategy proposed herein, called CPL-AdS, partitions the search interval into d subintervals, evaluates the location of the unknown point with respect to these subintervals using fast-converging epsilon-optimal L-RI LA, and prunes the search space in each iteration by eliminating at least one partition. The CPL-AdS algorithm is shown to provably converge to the unknown point with an arbitrary degree of accuracy with probability as close to unity as desired. Comprehensive experimental results confirm the fast and accurate convergence of the search for a wide range of values for the Environment's feedback accuracy parameter p, and thus has numerous potential applications.",,,,,"Oommen, B.

Models obtained by a heuristic assessment of the underlying system are generally highly granular with interpretable rules, while models algorithmically generated from an analysis of training data consist of a large number of rules with small granularity. This paper presents a method for increasing the granularity of rules while satisfying a prescribed precision bound on the training data. The model is generated by a two-stage process. The first step iteratively refines the partitions of the input domains until a rule base is generated that satisfies the precision bound. In this step, the antecedents of the rules are obtained from decomposable partitions of the input domains and the consequents are generated using proximity techniques. A greedy merging algorithm is then applied to increase the granularity of the rules while preserving the precision bound. To enhance the representational capabilities of a rule and reduce the number of rules required, the rules constructed by the merging procedure have multi-dimensional antecedents.

They can accommodate new input data, including new features, new classes, etc., through local element tuning. New connections and new neurons are created during the operation of the system. EFuNNs can learn spatial-temporal sequences in an adaptive way through one pass learning and automatically adapt their parameter values as they operate. Fuzzy or crisp rules can be inserted and extracted at any time of the EFuNN operation. The characteristics of EFuNNs are illustrated on several case study data sets for time series prediction and spoken word classification.

Here, the surrogate analysis is extended and four new types of nonlinear surrogates have been proposed, which are produced by randomizing one or multiple periodicity attributes while preserving certain individual relationships.

This parametrization has the Linear In The Parameters (LITP's) characteristic that allows standard parameter estimation technique to be used to estimate the parameters of the fuzzy system, The combination of the fuzzy system and the estimation method then performs as a nonlinear estimator.

Most proponents of the prototype theory conceive that objects may fall in a concept to some degree rather than the all-or-none membership in the classical theory, Fuzzy-set theory is compatible with the basic premises of the prototype theory of concept representation, Concept formation is defined as a machine learning task that captures concepts through categorizing the observation of objects and also uses them in classifying future experiences, A reasonable computational model of concept formation must reflect the characteristics of human concept learning and categorization, In this paper, the design and implementation of a fuzzy-set based concept formation system (FUZZ) is presented. The main feature of the FUZZ is that the concept hierarchy is nondisjoint, in which an instance may belong to two categories in different memberships, An information-theoretic evaluation measure called category binding to direct searches in the FUZZ is proposed, The learning and classification algorithms of the FUZZ are also given, In order to examine FUZZ's behavior, the results of some experiments are examined.",,,,,"Chen, C.

It was originally formulated as a difficult nonconvex integer problem. To make the MMC problem practical, the researchers either relaxed the original MMC problem to inefficient convex optimization problems or reformulated it to nonconvex optimization problems, which sacrifice the convexity for efficiency. However, no approaches can both hold the convexity and be efficient. In this paper, a new linearithmic time sparse and convex MMC algorithm, called support-vector-regression-based MMC (SVR-MMC), is proposed. Generally, it first uses the SVR as the core of the MMC. Then, it is relaxed as a convex optimization problem, which is iteratively solved by the cutting-plane algorithm. Each cutting-plane subproblem is further decomposed to a serial supervised SVR problem by a new global extended-level method (GELM). Finally, each supervised SVR problem is solved in a linear time complexity by a new sparse-kernel SVR (SKSVR) algorithm. We further extend the SVR-MMC algorithm to the multiple-kernel clustering (MKC) problem and the multiclass MMC (M3C) problem, which are denoted as SVR-MKC and SVR-M3C, respectively. One key point of the algorithms is the utilization of the SVR. It can prevent the MMC and its extensions meeting an integer matrix programming problem. Another key point is the new SKSVR. It provides a linear time interface to the nonlinear kernel scenarios, so that the SVR-MMC and its extensions can keep a linearthmic time complexity in nonlinear kernel scenarios. Our experimental results on various real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the SVR-MMC and its two extensions. Moreover, the unsupervised application of the SVR-MKC to the voice activity detection (VAD) shows that the SVR-MKC can achieve good performances that are close to its supervised counterpart, meet the real-time demand of the VAD, and need no labeling for model training.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,DEC,2012,42,6,,,,,1669,1692,,10.1109/TSMCB.2012.2197824,0.0,,,,,,,,22645273.0,,,,,WOS:000311353700014,0

Given a face from the probe set, one needs to determine whether a match in the database exists. This is under the assumption that in forensic applications, most suspects have their mug shots available in the database, and face recognition aims at recognizing the suspects when their faces of various poses are captured by a surveillance camera. This paper considers a different scenario: given a face with multiple poses available, which may or may not include a mug shot, develop a method to recognize the face with poses different from those captured. That is, given two disjoint sets of poses of a face, one for enrollment and the other for recognition, this paper reports a method best for handling such cases. The proposed method includes feature extraction and classification. For feature extraction, we first cluster the poses of each subject's face in the enrollment set into a few pose classes and then decompose the appearance of the face in each pose class using Embedded Hidden Markov Model, which allows us to define a set of subject-specific and pose-priented (SSPO) facial components for each subject.

Given a problem instance, the backbone variables are defined as the variables shared by all optimal solutions, and the fat variables are defined as the variables that are absent from every optimal solution. Identification of the backbone (fat) variables is essential for the heuristic algorithms exploiting such structures. Since the existing exact identification method, i.e., limit crossing (LC), is time consuming and sensitive to the upper bounds, it is hard to incorporate LC into heuristic algorithm design. In this paper, we develop the accelerated-LC (ALC)-based multilevel algorithm (ALCMA). In contrast to LC which repeatedly runs the time-consuming Lagrangian relaxation (LR) procedure, ALC is introduced in ALCMA such that LR is performed only once, and every backbone (fat) variable can be determined in O(1) time. Meanwhile, the upper bound sensitivity is eliminated by a dynamic pseudo upper bound mechanism. By combining ALC with the pseudo upper bound, ALCMA can efficiently find high-quality solutions within a series of reduced search spaces. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that ALCMA outperforms existing heuristic algorithms in terms of the average solution quality.",,,,,"Xuan, Jifeng/F-2177-2016","Xuan, Jifeng/0000-0002-2968-3496",,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,AUG,2012,42,4,,,SI,,1187,1202,,10.1109/TSMCB.2012.2188100,0.0,,,,,,,,22411026.0,,,,,WOS:000308995000019,0

This paper shows that both LS-SVM and PSVM can be simplified further and a unified learning framework of LS-SVM, PSVM, and other regularization algorithms referred to extreme learning machine (ELM) can be built. ELM works for the generalized single-hidden-layer feedforward networks (SLFNs), but the hidden layer (or called feature mapping) in ELM need not be tuned. Such SLFNs include but are not limited to SVM, polynomial network, and the conventional feedforward neural networks. This paper shows the following: 1) ELM provides a unified learning platform with a widespread type of feature mappings and can be applied in regression and multiclass classification applications directly; 2) from the optimization method point of view, ELM has milder optimization constraints compared to LS-SVM and PSVM; 3) in theory, compared to ELM, LS-SVM and PSVM achieve suboptimal solutions and require higher computational complexity; and 4) in theory, ELM can approximate any target continuous function and classify any disjoint regions.

This paper proposes a fuzzy integral-based gaze control architecture incorporated with the modified-univector field-based navigation for humanoid robots. To determine the gaze direction, four criteria based on local map confidence, waypoint, self-localization, and obstacles, are defined along with their corresponding partial evaluation functions. Using the partial evaluation values and the degree of consideration for criteria, fuzzy integral is applied to each candidate gaze direction for global evaluation. For the effective dynamic obstacle avoidance, partial evaluation functions about self-localization error and surrounding obstacles are also used for generating virtual dynamic obstacle for the modified-univector field method which generates the path and velocity of robot toward the next waypoint.

Although haptic feedback has been previously shown to be beneficial, the influence of the underlying biomechanical properties of the driver on the effectiveness of haptic feedback is largely unknown. The goal of this paper is to experimentally determine the biomechanical properties of the ankle-foot complex (i.e., the admittance) while performing a car-following task, thereby separating driver responses to visual feedback from those to designed haptic feedback. An experiment was conducted in a simplified fixed-base driving simulator, where ten participants were instructed to follow a lead vehicle, with and without the support of haptic feedback. During the experiment, the lead vehicle velocity was perturbed, and small stochastic torque perturbations were applied to the pedal. Both perturbations were separated in the frequency domain to allow the simultaneous estimation of frequency response functions of both the car-following control behavior and the biomechanical admittance. For comparison to previous experiments, the admittance was also estimated during three classical motion control tasks (resist forces, relax, and give way to forces). The main experimental hypotheses were that, first, the haptic feedback would encourage drivers to adopt a give way to force task, resulting in larger admittance compared with other tasks and, second, drivers needed less control effort to realize the same car-following performance. Time-and frequency-domain analyses provided evidence for both hypotheses. The developed methodology allows quantification of the range of admittances that a limb can adopt during vehicle control or while performing a variety of motion control tasks. It thereby allows detailed computational driver modeling and provides valuable information on how to design and evaluate continuous haptic feedback systems.",,,,,"Abbink, David A/G-2650-2015; MULDER, Max/G-6727-2011","Abbink, David A/0000-0001-7778-0090; MULDER, Max/0000-0002-0932-3979; Mulder, Mark/0000-0002-0195-045X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,OCT,2011,41,5,,,,,1239,1249,,10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2120606,0.0,,,,,,,,21536522.0,,,,,WOS:000295012000006,0

Its aim is to find suitable values for the kernel parameter. and the cost parameter C with a minimum amount of central processing unit time. The determination of the kernel parameter is based on the argument that, for most patterns, the decision function of the SVM should consist of a sufficiently large number of significant contributions. A unique property of the proposed method is that it retrieves the kernel parameter as a simple analytical function of the dimensionality of the feature space and the dispersion of the classes in that space.

To tackle the technical challenges raised by the dynamic nature of the stream data, i.e., increasing data volumes and evolving decision concepts, we propose a classifier-ensemble-based active learning framework that selectively labels instances from data streams to build a classifier ensemble. We argue that a classifier ensemble's variance directly corresponds to its error rate, and reducing a classifier ensemble's variance is equivalent to improving its prediction accuracy. Because of this, one should label instances toward the minimization of the variance of the underlying classifier ensemble. Accordingly, we introduce a minimum-variance (MV) principle to guide the instance labeling process for data streams. In addition, we derive an optimal-weight calculation method to determine the weight values for the classifier ensemble.

The basic idea of CLA is to use LA to adjust the state transition probability of stochastic CA. Recently, various types of CLA such as synchronous, asynchronous, and open CLAs have been introduced. In some applications such as cellular networks, we need to have a model of CLA for which multiple LAs reside in each cell. In this paper, we study a CLA model for which each cell has several LAs.

Second, we present a new algorithm, called adaptive Michigan PSO (AMPSO) in order to reduce the dimension of the search space and provide more flexibility than the former in this application. AMPSO is based on a different approach to particle swarms as each particle in the swarm represents a single prototype in the solution. The swarm does not converge to a single solution; instead, each particle is a local classifier, and the whole swarm is taken as the solution to the problem. It uses modified PSO equations with both particle competition and cooperation and a dynamic neighborhood. As an additional feature, in AMPSO, the number of prototypes represented in the swarm is able to adapt to the problem, increasing as needed the number of prototypes and classes of the prototypes that make the solution to the problem. We compared the results of the standard PSO and AMPSO in several benchmark problems from the University of California, Irvine, data sets and find that AMPSO always found a better solution than the standard PSO.

The concept is to transform a biometric signal or feature into a new one for enrollment and matching. For making cancelable fingerprint templates, previous approaches used either the relative position of a minutia to a core point or the absolute position of a minutia in a given fingerprint image. Thus, a query fingerprint is required to be accurately aligned to the enrolled fingerprint in order to obtain identically transformed minutiae. In this paper, we propose a new method for making cancelable fingerprint templates that do not require alignment. For each minutia, a rotation and translation invariant value is computed from the orientation information of neighboring local regions around the minutia. The invariant value is used as the input to two changing functions that output two values for the translational and rotational movements of the original minutia, respectively, in the cancelable template. When template is compromised, it is replaced by a new one generated by different changing functions. Our approach preserves the original geometric relationships (translation and rotation) between the enrolled and query templates after they are transformed. Therefore, the transformed templates can be used to verify a person without requiring alignment of the input fingerprint images. In our experiments, we evaluated the proposed method in terms of two criteria: performance and changeability. When evaluating the performance, we examined how verification accuracy varied as the transformed templates were used for matching. When evaluating the changeability, we measured the dissimilarities between the original and transformed templates, and between two differently transformed templates, which were obtained from the same original fingerprint. The experimental results show that the two criteria mutually affect each other and can be controlled by varying the control parameters of the changing functions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,AUG,2007,37,4,,,,,980,992,,10.1109/TSMCB.2007.896999,0.0,,,,,,,,17702294.0,,,,,WOS:000247833000018,0

Since the CA clustering algorithm is used to find the nearly optimal number of clusters and the centers of clusters in the clustering process, the CA clustering algorithm is applied to select the Gaussian kernel parameter. Additionally, an RSVR approach that relies on the standard deviation of a training error is proposed to obtain an epsilon in the loss function.

Coarse localization from the LVSM is fast, but not accurate enough, whereas localization from the location database using a voting algorithm is relatively slow, but more accurate. The integration of coarse and fine stages makes fast and reliable localization possible. If necessary., the localization result can be verified by epipolar geometry between the representative view in the database and the view to be localized. In addition, the localization system recovers the position of the camera by essential matrix decomposition. The localization system has been tested in indoor and outdoor environments.

A salient feature of this framework is that it is able to cope with various body postures and is in addition robust to noise, holes, irregular sampling and rigid transformations. Although whole human body scanners are now capable of routinely capturing the shape of the whole body in machine readable format, they have not yet realized their potential to provide automatic extraction of key body measurements. Automated production of anthropometric databases is a prerequisite to satisfying the needs of certain industrial sectors (e.g., the clothing industry). This implies that in order to extract specific measurements of interest, whole body 3-D scan data must be segmented by machine into subsets corresponding to functional human body parts. However, previously reported attempts at automating the segmentation process suffer from various limitations, such as being restricted to a standard specific posture and being vulnerable to scan data artifacts.

The relevant approaches share similarities, including modeling by automata, compositional modeling, and model-based reasoning. This paper aims to bridge two complementary approaches from these communities, namely, the diagnoser approach and the active system approach, respectively. The more significant shortcomings of such approaches are, on the one side, the need for the generation of the global system model and, on the other, the lack of monitoring capabilities. The former makes the application of the diagnoser approach prohibitive in real contexts, where the system model is too large to be generated, even offline. The latter requires the completion of the system observation before starting the diagnostic task, thereby, making the monitoring of the system. impossible. The bridged diagnostic method subsumes, to a large extent on the peculiarities of the two approaches and is capable of coping with an extended class of DESs that integrate both synchronous and asynchronous behavior. The bridge is built by extending the active system approach by means of several enhanced techniques, which eventually, allow the efficient monitoring of polymorphic DESs.

As a particular type of objects to be extracted coronal holes in EIT images have been chosen. The method described is based on the use of a watershed algorithm. The result of the watershed segmentation is a partition of the whole domain of the image into a large number of small regions. These regions are then combined in a region merging process. The proposed region merging algorithm iteratively adds the darkest regions and maximizes the average contrast between a current mask and a set of its neighboring regions.

The TDGAR learning scheme is a new hybrid GA, which integrates the TD prediction method and the GA to perform the reinforcement learning task, The TDGAR learning system is composed of two integrated feedforward networks. One neural network acts as a critic network to guide the learning of the other network (the action network) which determines the outputs (actions) of the TDGAR learning system, The action network can be a normal neural network or a neural fuzzy network, Using the TD prediction method, the critic network can predict the external reinforcement signal and provide a more informative internal reinforcement signal to the action network. The action network uses the GA to adapt itself according to the internal reinforcement signal, The key concept of the TDGAR learning scheme is to formulate the internal reinforcement signal as the fitness function for the GA such that the GA can evaluate the candidate solutions (chromosomes) regularly, even during periods without external feedback from the environment. This enables the GA to proceed to new generations regularly without waiting for the arrival of the external reinforcement signal. This can usually accelerate the GA learning since a reinforcement signal may only be available at a time long after a sequence of actions has occurred in the reinforcement learning problem, The proposed TDGAR learning system has been used to control an active magnetic bearing (AMB) system in practice.

The parti-game multiresolution learning approach [22] is applied for simultaneous and cooperative construction of a world model, and learning to navigate through an obstacle-free path from a starting position to a known goal region. The paper introduces a new approach, based on the application of the fuzzy ART neural architecture [7], for on-line map building from actual sensor data. This method is then integrated, as a complement, on the parti-game world model, allowing the system to make a more efficient use of collected sensor information. Then, a predictive on-line trajectory filtering method, is introduced in the learning approach. Instead of having a mechanical device moving to search the world, the idea is to have the system analyzing trajectories in a predictive mode, by taking advantage of the improved world model. The real robot will only more to try trajectories that have been predicted to be successful, allowing lower exploration costs. This results in an overall improved new method for goal-oriented navigation. It is assumed that the robot knows its own current world location-a simple dead-reckoning method is used for localization in our experiments. It is also assumed that the robot is able to perform sensor-based obstacle detection (not avoidance) and straight-line motions.

The execution of the rules is interpreted as the propagation of linguistic truth values of the linguistic truth-variable that reflect the linguistic degree of fulfillment of each of the propositions in the rules, This execution process is analyzed in two fields of application: control systems, where it is customary to assume t-norm operators as implication functions, and the aggregation process is implemented through the maximum operator and expert systems applications, where other implication functions may be needed and t-norm operators are generally used as aggregation operators. For both of these situations, we present a compaction mechanism which allows a noticeable part of the operations to be performed a priori, thus achieving an important computation time saving. Besides, a parameterization for both processes is used, allowing the FKB execution process to be performed through simple operations involving single numerical values (and this way no possibility distributions are directly involved).

The problem involves identifying a chosen subset of K out of N symbols through a series of inquiries and corresponding responses, Each inquiry is a subset of size K from the set of N symbols. Each response is the number of symbols which belong to both the chosen subset and the inquired subset. Mehrez and Steinberg [8] wished to develop an inquiry algorithm that would minimize the expected number of inquiries required to identify the chosen subset. The MIP is a form of knowledge acquisition problem from the field of artificial intelligence, For instance, an expert system infers knowledge from a set of examples, But how do you most quickly acquire the examples that knowledge is inferred from? The MIP is a special case of this problem. Although an optimal algorithm was not found by Mehrez and Steinberg, they described two general types of heuristics. We describe in this paper an optimal algorithm for the case of K = 2, and an improved heuristic for general K, which identifies a chosen subset with 6% fewer inquiries on average when N = 15, K = 3. The heuristic improves relative to the Type I heuristic as N increases, K held constant. The improved heuristic is concerned with the symbols yet unclassified as being in the chosen subset or not in the chosen subset, By inquiring subsets with all unclassified symbols, we most quickly ''span'' the set of unclassified numbers. Closed form equations are developed for the expected number of inquiries required and the variance of the number of inquiries required for the optimal algorithm, Computational studies are provided for Mehrez and Steinberg's [8] Type I heuristics, the K = 2 optimal algorithm, and the spanning heuristic.",,,,,"Kline, Douglas M/ABG-6760-2020; Kline, Douglas/L-1619-2015","Kline, Douglas/0000-0002-2061-5171",,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,,,,,APR,1997,27,2,,,,,228,238,,10.1109/3477.558804,0.0,,,,,,,,18255860.0,,,,,WOS:A1997WP15000006,0

It is a generalized form of expert control using fuzzy sets in the definition of vague/linguistic predicates, modelling a system by If... then rules. In the classical approaches it is necessary that observations on the actual state of the system partly match (fire) one or several rules in the model (fired rules), and the conclusion is calculated by the evaluation of the degrees of matching and the fired rules. Interpolation helps reducing the complexity as it allows rule bases with gaps, Various interpolation approaches are shown. It is proposed that dense rule bases should be reduced so that only the minimal necessary number of rules remain still containing the essential information in the original base, and all other rules are replaced by the interpolation algorithm that however can recover them with a certain accuracy prescribed before reduction. The interpolation method used for demonstration is the Lagrange-method supplying the best fitting minimal degree polynomial, The paper concentrates on the reduction technique that is rather independent from the style of the interpolation model, but cannot be given in the form of a tractable algorithm.

First a 6-valued NPN logic is introduced which extends the usual 4-valued Q-algebra (S, approximate to, +, x) and S = {+, -, 0, ?} by adding one more level of specification; and then a real-valued NPN fuzzy logic is introduced which extends the 6-valued model to the real space {For All(x, y) \ (x, y) is an element of [-1, 0] x [0, 1]} and adds infinite levels of specifications. As a generalization, a fuzzy set theory is presented that allows beta-level fuzzy number-based NPN variables (x, y) to be substituted into (S, approximate to, +, x) where x stands for any NPN T-norm; + stands for disjunction (boolean OR) or union (boolean OR), and beta is the number of alpha-cuts. An interval-based NPN variable is proved a one level nesting of real-valued NPN variables; and a beta-level fuzzy number-based NPN variable is proved a beta + 1 level nesting of interval-based NPN variables. With the nesting features beta-level fuzzy number-based NPN operations are converted to interval-based and then real-valued NPN operations. The conversions lead to significant simplifications with which real-valued NPN fuzzy relations are generalized to fuzzy number-based NPN linguistic relations. A beta O(n(3)) algorithm is presented for the computation of fuzzy number-based NPN linguistic transitive closures. As a generalization in a different direction, the real-valued NPN logic is extended to an NPN algebra and an NPN linear Algebra that allow usual algebraic operations to be performed on real-valued NPN variables and matrices. Major advantages of the new family of bipolar models include: 1) it retains the key features of commutativity, associativity, and distributivity of the 4-valued model; 2) it formalizes a unified approach to polarity and fuzziness; 3) it combines linguistic descriptions and numerical computations into one framework; 4) it captures the double-sided nature of human decision making and opens a background for bipolar fuzzy inference; and 5) it provides a basis for conflict integration, resolution and multiagent coordination.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,,,,,AUG,1996,26,4,,,,,561,574,,10.1109/3477.517031,0.0,,,,,,,,18263054.0,,,,,WOS:A1996UY96700005,0

One of the fundamental characteristics of distribution networks is the functional robustness, which reflects the ability of maintaining its function in the face of internal or external disruptions. In view of the fact that most distribution networks do not have any centralized control mechanisms, we consider the problem of how to improve the functional robustness in a decentralized way. To achieve this goal, we study two important problems: 1) how to formally measure the functional robustness, and 2) how to improve the functional robustness of a network based on the local interaction of its nodes. First, we derive a utility function in terms of network entropy to characterize the functional robustness of a distribution network. Second, we propose a decentralized network pricing mechanism, where each node need only communicate with its distribution neighbors by sending a price signal to its upstream neighbors and receiving price signals from its downstream neighbors. By doing so, each node can determine its outflows by maximizing its own payoff function. Our mathematical analysis shows that the decentralized pricing mechanism can produce results equivalent to those of an ideal centralized maximization with complete information. Finally, to demonstrate the properties of our mechanism, we carry out a case study on the U. S. natural gas distribution network.

In this paper, we consider multiple features from different views, i.e., color histogram, Hausdorff edge feature, and skeleton feature, to represent cartoon characters with different colors, shapes, and gestures. Each visual feature reflects a unique characteristic of a cartoon character, and they are complementary to each other for retrieval and synthesis. However, how to combine the three visual features is the second key issue of our application. By simply concatenating them into a long vector, it will end up with the so-called curse of dimensionality, let alone their heterogeneity embedded in different visual feature spaces. Here, we introduce a semisupervised multiview subspace learning (semi-MSL) algorithm, to encode different features in a unified space. Specifically, under the patch alignment framework, semi-MSL uses the discriminative information from labeled cartoon characters in the construction of local patches where the manifold structure revealed by unlabeled cartoon characters is utilized to capture the geometric distribution. The experimental evaluations based on both cartoon character retrieval and clip synthesis demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for cartoon application. Moreover, additional results of content-based image retrieval on benchmark data suggest the generality of semi-MSL for other applications.",,,,,"Seah, Hock Soon/AAK-9900-2020; Tao, Dacheng/A-5449-2012","Seah, Hock Soon/0000-0003-2699-7147; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,OCT,2012,42,5,,,,,1413,1427,,10.1109/TSMCB.2012.2192108,0.0,,,,,,,,22547459.0,,,,,WOS:000308995500009,0

A highly plausible solution involves performing a dense form of alignment, where 60-70 fiducial facial points are tracked with high accuracy. The problem is that, in practice, this type of dense alignment had so far been impossible to achieve in a generic sense, mainly due to poor reliability and robustness. Instead, many expression detection methods have opted for a coarse form of face alignment, followed by an application of a biologically inspired appearance descriptor such as the histogram of oriented gradients or Gabor magnitudes. Encouragingly, recent advances to a number of dense alignment algorithms have demonstrated both high reliability and accuracy for unseen subjects [e.g., constrained local models (CLMs)]. This begs the question: Aside from countering against illumination variation, what do these appearance descriptors do that standard pixel representations do not? In this paper, we show that, when close to perfect alignment is obtained, there is no real benefit in employing these different appearance-based representations (under consistent illumination conditions). In fact, when misalignment does occur, we show that these appearance descriptors do work well by encoding robustness to alignment error. For this work, we compared two popular methods for dense alignment-subject-dependent active appearance models versus subject-independent CLMs-on the task of action-unit detection. These comparisons were conducted through a battery of experiments across various publicly available data sets (i.e., CK+, Pain, M3, and GEMEP-FERA).

This fuzzy approximation technique allows users to apply a much wider and more flexible range of prior and likelihood probability density functions than found in most Bayesian inference schemes. The technique does not restrict the user to the few known closed-form conjugacy relations between the prior and likelihood. It allows the user in many cases to describe the densities with words and just two rules can absorb any bounded closed-form probability density directly into the rulebase. Learning algorithms can tune the expert rules as well as grow them from sample data. The learning laws and fuzzy approximators have a tractable form because of the convex-sum structure of additive fuzzy systems. This convex-sum structure carries over to the fuzzy posterior approximator. We prove a uniform approximation theorem for Bayesian posteriors: An additive fuzzy posterior uniformly approximates the posterior probability density if the prior or likelihood densities are continuous and bounded and if separate additive fuzzy systems approximate the prior and likelihood densities. Simulations demonstrate this fuzzy approximation of priors and posteriors for the three most common conjugate priors (as when a beta prior combines with a binomial likelihood to give a beta posterior). Adaptive fuzzy systems can also approximate non-conjugate priors and likelihoods as well as approximate hyperpriors in hierarchical Bayesian inference. The number of fuzzy rules can grow exponentially in iterative Bayesian inference if the previous posterior approximator becomes the new prior approximator.,,,,,,"Osoba, Osonde/0000-0002-5232-2779",,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,OCT,2011,41,5,,,,,1183,1197,,10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2114879,0.0,,,,,,,,21478078.0,,,,,WOS:000295012000002,0

The first one, which is the so-called multidimensional (MD) PSO, re-forms the native structure of swarm particles in such a way that they can make interdimensional passes with a dedicated dimensional PSO process. Therefore, in an MD search space, where the optimum dimension is unknown, swarm particles can seek both positional and dimensional optima. This eventually removes the necessity of setting a fixed dimension a priori, which is a common drawback for the family of swarm optimizers. Nevertheless, MD PSO is still susceptible to premature convergences due to lack of divergence. Among many PSO variants in the literature, none yields a robust solution, particularly over multimodal complex problems at high dimensions. To address this problem, we propose the fractional global best formation (FGBF) technique, which basically collects all the best dimensional components and fractionally creates an artificial global best (alpha GB) particle that has the potential to be a better guide than the PSO's native gbest particle. This way, the potential diversity that is present among the dimensions of swarm particles can be efficiently used within the alpha GB particle. We investigated both individual and mutual applications of the proposed techniques over the following two well-known domains: 1) nonlinear function minimization and 2) data clustering. An extensive set of experiments shows that in both application domains, MD PSO with FGBF exhibits an impressive speed gain and converges to the global optima at the true dimension regardless of the search",,,,,"Yıldırım, Alper/ABI-5423-2020; Gabbouj, Moncef/G-4293-2014; Kiranyaz, Serkan/AAK-1416-2021","Yıldırım, Alper/0000-0002-4099-288X; Gabbouj, Moncef/0000-0002-9788-2323; kiranyaz, serkan/0000-0003-1551-3397; Ince, Turker/0000-0002-8495-8958",,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,APR,2010,40,2,,,,,298,319,,10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2015054,0.0,,,,,,,,19661007.0,,,,,WOS:000275665300003,0

The concept has been evaluated within a P2P agent application in which each agent has a goal to maintain a preferred number of connections to a number of service providing agents. Using this algorithm, the agents update a weight value associated with each connection, based on the perceived utility of the connection to the corresponding agent. This utility function can be a combination of several node or edge parameters, such as degree k of the target node, or frequency of the message response from the node. This weight is updated using a set of Hebbian-style learning rules, such that the network as a whole exhibits adaptive self-organizing behavior. The principal result is the finding that by limiting the connection neighborhood within the overlay topology, the resulting P2P network can be made highly resilient to targeted attacks on high-degree nodes, while maintaining search efficiency.",,,,,"Tavares, António JV/A-7115-2008; wang, fang/GYD-4295-2022",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,DEC,2006,36,6,,,,,1230,1236,,10.1109/TSMCB.2006.873211,0.0,,,,,,,,17186799.0,,,,,WOS:000242690600004,0

The variable gain then becomes a function of a gain parameter that is computed to neutralize the effect of disturbance term, which is, in essence, the deviation of the actual system dynamics from the nominal plant as the system traverses a specific trajectory. This controller is shown to stabilize the T-S fuzzy model. In controller II, individual linear subsystems are locally stabilized. Fuzzy blending of individual control actions is shown to make the T-S fuzzy system Lyapunov stable.

Its objective function is the inner product of the dynamic external wrench and a vector, and the constraints on the vector, given by a set of linear inequalities, define a polytope. The solution to the LP problem can always be attained at the vertex of the polytope called the solution vertex. We notice that the polytope is determined by the grasp configuration.

Most methods propose to partition the concave object into convex subobjects and then solve the convex problem between all possible subobject combinations. This can add a large computational expense to the solution of the minimum distance problem. In this paper, an optimization-based approach is used to solve the concave problem without the need for partitioning concave objects into convex pieces. Since the optimization problem is no longer uni-modal (i.e., has more than one local minimum point), global optimization techniques are used. Simulated Annealing (SA) and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are used to solve the concave minimum distance problem. In order to reduce the computational expense, it is proposed to replace the objects' geometry by a set of points on the surface of each body. This reduces the problem to an unconstrained combinatorial optimization problem, where the combination of points (one on the surface of each body) that minimizes the distance will be the solution. Additionally, if the surface points are set as the nodes of a surface mesh, it is possible to accelerate the convergence of the global optimization algorithm by using a hill-climbing local optimization algorithm.

Reinforcement learning is the most commonly used learning process for multiagent systems. However, it still has some drawbacks, including modeling other learning agents present in the domain as part of the state of the environment, and some states are experienced much less than others, or some state-action pairs are never visited during the learning phase. Further, before completing the learning process, an agent cannot exhibit a certain behavior in some states that may be experienced sufficiently. In this study, we propose a novel multiagent learning approach to handle these problems. Our approach is based on utilizing the mining process for modular cooperative learning systems. It incorporates fuzziness and online analytical processing (OLAP) based mining to effectively process the information reported by agents. First, we describe a fuzzy data cube OLAP architecture which facilitates effective storage and processing of the state information reported by agents. This way, the action of the other agent, not even in the visual environment(1) of the agent under consideration, can simply be predicted by extracting online association rules, a well-known data mining technique, from the constructed data cube. Second, we present a new action selection model, which is also based on association rules mining. Finally, we generalize not sufficiently experienced states, by mining multilevel association rules from the proposed fuzzy data cube. Experimental results obtained on two different versions of a well-known pursuit domain show the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy OLAP mining based modular learning approach.

Since the optimal ORFNN parameters for a best approximation are generally unavailable, an adaptive algorithm with projection mechanism is derived to update all the consequent, premise, and recurrent parameters during iteration processes. Only one network is required to design the ORFNN-based DAILC and the plant nonlinearities, especially the nonlinear input gain, are allowed to be totally unknown. Based on a Lyapunov-like analysis, we show that all adjustable parameters and internal signals remain bounded for all iterations. Furthermore, the norm of state tracking error vector will asymptotically converge to a tunable residual set as iteration goes to infinity. Finally, iterative learning control of two nonlinear systems, inverted pendulum system and Chua's chaotic circuit, are performed to verify the tracking performance of the proposed learning scheme.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,JUN,2004,34,3,,,,,1348,1359,,10.1109/TSMCB.2004.824525,0.0,,,,,,,,15484908.0,,,,,WOS:000221578100004,0

The action is not in question it is the time of action. We call these time for action decisions, a prototypical example being deciding when to leave on a journey. We point out that during this type of decision process, the decision-maker recognizes two groups of forces acting on him: one that pushes him to act now and other that pushes him act later. We note that the strength of these forces depends on the information available about various uncertainties associated with the situation. It also strongly depends upon the personality of the decision-maker. We observe that as time passes these conflicting forces tend to build up an anxiety in the decision-maker resulting in an action being taken at a time of most intense anxiety. In this paper using the ideas of Possibility and,necessity measures to enable different interpretations of uncertain information we investigate the temporal profile of the decision-maker's anxiety as a function of their decision attitude.

BOCOP with n binary variables has two incommensurable and often competing objectives: minimizing the sum r of values of all binary variables and optimizing the system performance. BOCOP is NP-hard having a finite number C (n, r) of feasible solutions for a limited number r. The merits of IGA are threefold as follows: 1) OAX with the systematic reasoning ability based on orthogonal experimental design can efficiently explore the search space of C (n, r); 2) IGA can efficiently search the space of C (n, r +/- 1) by inheriting a good solution in the space of C (n, r); and 3) The single-objective IGA can economically obtain a complete set of high-quality nondominated solutions in a single run. Two applications of BOCOP are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm: polygonal approximation problem (PAP) and the problem of editing a minimum reference set for nearest neighbor classification (MRSP).

In addition, sometimes, selection of a group of alternatives (instead of only one best alternative) is necessary. Traditional decision making approaches treat the set of alternatives with the same method of analysis and selection. In this paper, we propose clustering alternatives into different groups so that different methods of analysis, selection, and implementation for each group can be applied. As an example, consider the selection of a group of functions (or tasks) to be processed by a group of processors. The set of tasks can be grouped according to their similar criteria, and hence, each cluster of tasks to be processed by a processor. The selection of the best alternative for each clustered group can be performed using existing methods; however, the process of selecting groups is different than the process of selecting alternatives within a group. We develop theories and procedures for clustering discrete multiple criteria alternatives. We also demonstrate how the set of alternatives is clustered into mutually exclusive groups based on 1) similar features among alternatives; 2) ideal (or most representative) alternatives given by the decision maker; and 3) other preferential information of the decision maker. The clustering of multiple criteria alternatives also has the following advantages. 1) It decreases the set of alternatives to be considered by the decision maker (for example, different decision makers are assigned to different groups of alternatives). 2) It decreases the number of criteria. 3) It may provide a different approach for analyzing multiple decision makers problems. Each decision maker may cluster alternatives differently, and hence, clustering of alternatives may provide a basis for negotiation. The developed approach is applicable for solving a class of telecommunication networks problems where a set of objects (such as routers, processors, or intelligent autonomous vehicles) are to be clustered into similar groups.

In this paper, we present a compaction algorithm for generating compact vector sets to estimate power efficiently. Power can be estimated using dynamic (simulation) or static (statistical/probabilistic) techniques. Dynamic power estimation techniques simulate the design using a large input vector set for accurate estimation. However, the simulation time is prohibitively long for bigger designs with larger vector sets. The statistical methods, on the other hand, use analytical tools that make them faster but less accurate. To achieve the accuracy of dynamic power estimation and the speed of statistical methods, one approach is to generate a compact, representative vector set that has the same switching transition behavior as the original larger vector set. The compaction algorithm presented in this paper uses fractal concepts to generate such a compact hector set. The fractal technique quantifies correlation by a fractal parameter which can be determined faster than calculating correlation explicitly. Experimental results on circuits from the ISCAS85 and ISCAS89 benchmark suites, with correlated input vector sets, resulted in a maximum compaction ratio of 65.57X (average 38.14X) and maximum power estimation error of 2.4% (average 2.06%).

However, for evenly distributed MFs, there exists a potential problem that may adversely affect the control performance; that is, if the actual inputs are not equally distributed, but instead concentrate within a certain interval that is only part of the entire input area, this will result in two negative effects, On one hand, the MFs staying in the dense-input area will not be sufficient to react precisely to the inputs, because these inputs are too close to each other compared to the MFs in this area. The same fuzzy control output could he triggered for several different inputs. On the other hand, some of the MFs assigned for the sparse-input area are wasted. In this paper we argue that, if we arrange the placement of these MFs according to a statistical study of feedback errors in a closed-loop system, we ran expect a better control performance. To this end, we introduce a new mechanism to modify the evenly distributed MFs with the help of a technique termed histogram equalization. The histogram of the errors is actually the spatial distribution of real-time errors of the control system. To illustrate the proposed MF modification approach, a computer simulation of a simple system that has a known mathematical model is first analyzed, leading to our understanding of how this histogram-based modification mechanism functions. We then apply this method to an experimental laser tracking system to demonstrate that in real-world applications, a better control performance can be obtained by using this proposed technique.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,FEB,2001,31,1,,,,,125,132,,10.1109/3477.907571,0.0,,,,,,,,18244774.0,,,,,WOS:000167276800011,0

When the FRS is adopted to model a fuzzy system, most of the existing identification algorithms focus on parameter estimation and less on the structure identification. In this paper, these two issues are addressed. New theoretical understandings on solving a system of fuzzy relational equations exactly and approximately are presented and their implications on the use of FRS to encode fuzzy rulebases are highlighted. Based upon the guided evolutionary simulated annealing (GESA) algorithm [11], an evolutionary identification formulation called EVIDENT capable for both parameter and structure identifications in fuzzy system models is proposed.

Therefore, we can not directly apply those existing nonlinear optimization methods, Even if ave want to use the nonlinear optimization methods, a closed-form solution can be first applied to obtain accurate enough initial values, Hence, this paper considers only methods that provide closed-form solutions, i,e,, those requiring no initial estimates, Notice that most existing closed-form solutions require pose (i.e., both position and orientation) measurements, However, as far as we know, there is no inexpensive technique which can provide accurate pose measurements. Therefore, existing closed-form solutions based on pose measurements can not give us the required accuracy, as a result, we have developed a new method that does not require orientation measurements and can use only the position measurement of a calibration point to obtain highly accurate estimates of kinematic parameters using closed form solutions. The proposed method is based on the complete and parametrically continuous (CPC) kinematic model, and can be applied to any kind of kinematic parameter identification problems with or without multiple end-effectors, providing that the links are rigid, the joints are either revolute or prismatic and no closed-loop kinematic chain is included, Simulations and real experiments have shown that the proposed method of using only point measurements is more robust against noise than those existing closed-form solutions using both position and orientation measurements when calibrating our binocular head.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,APR,1998,28,2,,,,,258,267,,10.1109/3477.662767,0.0,,,,,,,,18255944.0,,,,,WOS:000072641600014,0

On the other hand, the larger dimension of the features d can generally make this CPL-AdS strategy avoid oscillation and converge faster. This paper presents a generalized universal decision formula to solve this bottleneck problem. As a matter of fact, this decision formula has a wider usage beyond handling out this SPL problems, such as dealing with deterministic point location problems and searching data in Single Instruction Stream-Multiple Data Stream based on Concurrent Read and Exclusive Write parallel computer model. Meanwhile, we generalized the CPL-AdS strategy with an extending formula, which is capable of tracking an unknown dynamic parameter lambda* in both informative and deceptive environments. Furthermore, we employed different learning automata in the generalized CPL-AdS method to find out if faster learning algorithm will lead to better realization of the generalized CPL-AdS method.

It enables the automatic control of inertia weight, acceleration coefficients, and other algorithmic parameters at run time to improve the search efficiency and convergence speed. Then, an elitist learning strategy is performed when the evolutionary state is classified as convergence state. The strategy will act on the globally best particle to jump out of the likely local optima. The APSO has comprehensively been evaluated on 12 unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions. The effects of parameter adaptation and elitist learning will be studied.

An important difficulty in applying this technique to real systems is dealing with the uncertainties associated with the system itself and with the measurements. In this paper, this uncertainty is taken into account by the use of intervals for the parameters of the model and for the measurements. The method that is proposed in this paper checks the consistency between the system's behavior, obtained from the measurements, and the model's behavior; if they are inconsistent, then there is a fault. The problem of detecting faults is stated as a quantified real constraint satisfaction problem, which can be solved using the modal interval analysis (MIA). MIA is used because it provides powerful tools to extend the calculations over real functions to intervals. To improve the results of the detection of the faults, the simultaneous use of several sliding time windows is proposed. The result of implementing this method is SemiQUALitative TRACKing (SQualTrack), a fault-detection tool that is robust in the sense that it does not generate false alarms, i.e., if there are false alarms, they indicate either that the interval model does not represent the system adequately or that the interval measurements do not represent the true values of the variables adequately.

However, this assumption is not valid in most cases, so the approximation is not accurate in these cases. To solve this challenging problem, we propose a volume-based heat-diffusion model (VHDM). In VHDM, the volume is theoretically justified by handling the input data that are unevenly distributed on an unknown manifold. We also propose a novel volume-based heat-diffusion classifier (VHDC) based on VHDM. One of the advantages of VHDC is that the computational complexity is linear on the number of edges given a constructed graph. Moreover, we give an analysis on the stability of VHDC with respect to its three free parameters, and we demonstrate the connection between VHDC and some other classifiers. Experiments show that VHDC performs better than Parzen window approach, K nearest neighbor, and the HDC without volumes in prediction accuracy and outperforms some recently proposed transductive-learning algorithms.

The identification of a model to estimate the subjective workload score of individuals under different workload situations is too ambitious a task because different individuals (due to different body conditions, emotional states, age, gender, etc.) show different physiological responses (assessed by evaluating the HR signal) under different workload situations. This is equivalent to saying that the mathematical mappings between physiological parameters and the workload score are uncertain. Our approach to deal with the uncertainties in a workload-modeling problem consists of the following steps: 1) The uncertainties arising due the individual variations in identifying a common model valid for all the individuals are filtered out using a fuzzy filter; 2) stochastic modeling of the uncertainties (provided by the fuzzy filter) use finite-mixture models and utilize this information regarding uncertainties for identifying the structure and initial parameters of a workload model; and 3) finally, the workload model parameters for an individual are identified in an online scenario using machine learning algorithms. The contribution of this paper is to propose, with a mathematical analysis, a fuzzy-based modeling technique that first filters out the uncertainties from the modeling problem, analyzes the uncertainties statistically using finite-mixture modeling, and, finally, utilizes the information about uncertainties for adapting the workload model to an individual's physiological conditions.

Initially, Galerkin's method is applied to the PDE system to derive a nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE) system that accurately describes the dynamics of the dominant (slow) modes of the PDE system. Subsequently, a systematic modeling procedure is given to construct exactly a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model for the finite-dimensional ODE system under state constraints. Then, based on the T-S fuzzy model, a sufficient condition for the existence of a stabilizing fuzzy controller is derived, which guarantees that the state constraints are satisfied and provides an upper bound on the quadratic performance function for the finite-dimensional slow system. The resulting fuzzy controllers can also guarantee the exponential stability of the closed-loop PDE system. Moreover, a local optimization algorithm based on the linear matrix inequalities is proposed to compute the feedback gain matrices of a suboptimal fuzzy controller in the sense of minimizing the quadratic performance bound.

Hence, it can be used to improve the generalization performance of Bayesian network classifiers. Until now, BMA of Bayesian network classifiers has only been performed in some restricted forms, e.g., the model is averaged given a single node-order, because of its heavy computational burden. However, it can be hard to obtain a good node-order when the available training dataset is sparse. To alleviate this problem, we propose BMA of Bayesian network classifiers over several distinct node-orders obtained using the Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling technique. The proposed method was examined using two synthetic problems and four real-life datasets. First, we show that the proposed method is especially effective when the given dataset is very sparse. The classification accuracy of averaging over multiple node-orders was higher in most cases than that achieved using a single node-order in our experiments. We also present experimental results for test datasets with unobserved variables, where the quality of the averaged node-order is more important. Through these experiments, we show that the difference in classification performance between the cases of multiple node-orders and single node-order is related to the level of noise, confirming the relative benefit of averaging over multiple node-orders for incomplete data.

In an attempt to make effective use of the simplex operation in a hybrid GA framework, we used an elite-based hybrid architecture that applies one simplex step to a top portion of the ranked population, We compared our approach with five alternative optimization techniques including a simplex-GA hybrid independently developed by Renders-Bersini (R-B) and adaptive simulated annealing (ASA), Our empirical evaluations showed that our hybrid approach for the metabolic modeling problem outperformed all other techniques in terms of accuracy and convergence rate, We used two additional function optimization problems to compare our approach with the five alternative methods, For a sin function maximization problem, our hybrid approach yields the fastest convergence rate without sacrificing the accuracy of the solution found.

This kind of investigation may provide clues on how biology achieves accurate control of non-stiff-joint robot with low-power actuators which involve controlling systems with high inertial components. This paper studies how a basic temporal-correlation kernel including long-term depression (LTD) and a constant long-term potentiation (LTP) at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses can effectively infer corrective models. We evaluate how this spike-timing-dependent plasticity correlates sensorimotor activity arriving through the parallel fibers with teaching signals (dependent on error estimates) arriving through the climbing fibers from the inferior olive. This paper addresses the study of how these LTD and LTP components need to be well balanced with each other to achieve accurate learning. This is of interest to evaluate the relevant role of homeostatic mechanisms in biological systems where adaptation occurs in a distributed manner.

Traditionally, these data structures reside in the main memory and rely on the existing paging mechanism of the virtual memory manager (VMM) to handle the storage problem when they go out of the primary memory. Typically, VMM stores the overloaded data into the secondary memory based on some preassumed memory usage criteria. However, this direct and unplanned use of virtual memory results in an unpredictable behavior or thrashing, as depicted by some of the works described in the literature. This problem is tackled in this paper by presenting an ARM model capable of mining a transactional database, regardless of its size and without relying on the underlying VMM; the proposed approach could use only a bounded portion of the primary memory and this gives the opportunity to assign other parts of the main memory to other tasks with different priority. In other words, we propose a specialized memory management system which caters to the needs of the ARM model in such a way that the proposed data structure is constructed in the available allocated primary memory first. If at any point the structure grows out of the allocated memory quota, it is forced to be partially saved on secondary memory. The secondary memory version of the structure is accessed in a block-by-block basis so that both the spatial and temporal localities of the I/O access are optimized. Thus, the proposed framework takes control of the virtual memory access and hence manages the required virtual memory in an optimal way to the best benefit of the mining process to be served.

The algorithm looks for the best closed-loop policy that can be represented using a given number of basis functions (BFs), where a discrete action is assigned to each BF. The type of the BFs and their number are specified in advance and determine the complexity of the representation. Considerable flexibility is achieved by optimizing the locations and shapes of the BFs, together with the action assignments. The optimization is carried out with the cross-entropy method and evaluates the policies by their empirical return from a representative set of initial states. The return for each representative state is estimated using Monte Carlo simulations. The resulting algorithm for cross-entropy policy search with adaptive BFs is extensively evaluated in problems with two to six state variables, for which it reliably obtains good policies with only a small number of BFs. In these experiments, cross-entropy policy search requires vastly fewer BFs than value-function techniques with equidistant BFs, and outperforms policy search with a competing optimization algorithm called DIRECT.",,,,,"Busoniu, Lucian/C-3275-2012; Babuska, Robert/D-6332-2012; De Schutter, Bart/B-7978-2011","Babuska, Robert/0000-0001-9578-8598; De Schutter, Bart/0000-0001-9867-6196; Busoniu, Lucian/0000-0001-8017-1296",,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,FEB,2011,41,1,,,,,196,209,,10.1109/TSMCB.2010.2050586,0.0,,,,,,,,20570774.0,,,,,WOS:000286388300016,0

J,"Park, KR",,,,"Park, Kang Ryoung",,,A real-time gaze position estimation method based on a 3-D eye model,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS,,,,,,,,,,,,"This paper proposes a new gaze-detection method based on a 3-D eye position and the gaze vector of the human eyeball. Seven new developments compared to previous works are presented. First, a method of using three camera systems, i.e., one wide-view camera and two narrow-view cameras, is proposed. The narrow-view cameras use autozooming, focusing, panning, and tilting procedures (based on the detected 3-D eye feature position) for gaze detection. This allows for natural head and eye movement by users. Second, in previous conventional gaze-detection research, one or multiple illuminators were used. These studies did not consider specular reflection (SR) problems, which were caused by the illuminators when working with users who wore glasses. To solve this problem, a method based on dual illuminators is proposed in this paper. Third, the proposed method does not require user-dependent calibration, so all procedures for detecting gaze position operate automatically without human intervention. Fourth, the intrinsic characteristics of the human eye, such as the disparity between the pupillary and the visual axes in order to obtain accurate gaze positions, are considered. Fifth, all the coordinates obtained by the left and right narrow-view cameras, as well as the wide-view camera coordinates and the monitor coordinates, are unified. This simplifies the complex 3-D converting calculation and allows for calculation of the 3-D feature position and gaze position on the monitor. Sixth, to upgrade eye-detection performance when using a wide-view camera, the adaptive-selection method is used. This involves an IR-LED on/off scheme, an AdaBoost classifier, and a principle component analysis method based on the number of SR elements. Finally, the proposed method uses an eigenvector matrix (instead of simply averaging six gaze vectors) in order to obtain a more accurate final gaze vector that can compensate for noise. Experimental results show that the root mean square error of gaze detection was about 0.627 cm on a 19-in monitor. The processing speed of the proposed method (used to obtain the gaze position on the monitor) was 32 ms (using a Pentium IV 1.8-GHz PC). It was possible to detect the user's gaze position at real-time speed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,FEB,2007,37,1,,,,,199,212,,10.1109/TSMCB.2006.883426,0.0,,,,,,,,17278572.0,,,,,WOS:000244131800020,0

In this context, the data associated with one class are far fewer than those associated with the other class. Traditional machine learning methods seeking classification accuracy over a full range of instances are not suitable to deal with this problem, since they tend to classify all the data into a majority class, usually the less important class. In this correspondence, the authors describe a new approach named the biased minimax probability machine (BMPM) to deal with the problem of imbalanced learning. This BMPM model is demonstrated to provide an elegant and systematic way for imbalanced learning. More specifically, by controlling the accuracy of the majority class under all possible choices of class-conditional densities with a given mean and covariance matrix, this model can quantitatively and systematically incorporate a bias for the minority class. By establishing an explicit connection between the classification accuracy and the bias, this approach distinguishes itself from the many current imbalanced-learning methods; these methods often impose a certain bias on the minority data by adapting intermediate factors via the trial-and-error procedure.

Current palmprint-based systems are more user friendly, more cost effective, and require fewer data signatures than traditional fingerprint-based identification systems. The principal lines and wrinkles captured in a low-resolution palmprint image provide more than enough information to uniquely identify an individual. This paper presents a palmprint identification scheme that characterizes a palmprint using a set of statistical signatures. The palmprint is first transformed into the wavelet domain, and the directional context of each wavelet subband is defined and computed in order to collect the predominant coefficients of its principal lines and wrinkles. A set of statistical signatures, which includes gravity center, density, spatial dispersivity and energy, is then defined to characterize the palmprint with the selected directional context values. A classification and identification scheme based on these signatures is subsequently developed. This scheme exploits the features of principal lines and prominent wrinkles sufficiently and achieves satisfactory results.

Existing segmentation methods apply simple criteria to detect human objects, leading to the restriction of the usage or a high segmentation error.

A fuzzy self-chistering technique is used to divide the I base frame of a video stream into a set of segments which are then categorized as foreground or background based on a combination of multiple criteria. Then, human objects in the base frame and the remaining frames of the video stream are precisely located by a fuzzy neural network constructed with the fuzzy rules previously obtained and is trained by a singular value decomposition (SVD)-based hybrid learning algorithm.

We have investigated these two aspects but will concentrate on the eye gaze estimation in this paper. We present a novel approach called the one-circle algorithm for measuring the eye gaze using a monocular image that zooms in on only one eye of a person. Observing that the iris contour is a circle, we estimate the normal direction of this iris circle, considered as the eye gaze, from its elliptical image. From basic projective geometry, an ellipse can be back-projected into space onto two circles of different orientations. However, by using a geometric constraint, namely, that the distance between the eyeball's center and the two eye corners should be equal to each other, the correct solution can be disambiguated. This allows us to obtain a higher resolution image of the iris with a zoom-in camera, thereby achieving higher accuracies in the estimation. A general approach that combines head pose determination with eye gaze estimation is also proposed. The searching of the eye gaze is guided by the head pose information. The robustness of our gaze determination approach was verified statistically by the extensive experiments on synthetic and real image data. The two key contributions in this paper are that we show the possibility of finding the unique eye gaze direction from a single image of one eye and that one can obtain better accuracy as a consequence of this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,JUN,2002,32,3,,,,,332,350,,10.1109/TSMCB.2002.999809,0.0,,,,,,,,18238131.0,,,,,WOS:000175449800008,0

The combination of these two extensions brings the considered system behavior(s) to the realm of probabilistic automata, an area of increasing academic interest. For the resulting model, and under the assumption of Markovian timings, it develops an analytical methodology for selecting the optimal deadlock resolution strategy that maximizes the steady-state system throughput, and it demonstrates its effectiveness through application to a prototype system configuration. The obtained results provide an interesting analytical expression of the need to assess the gains obtained by the increased concurrency supported by the deadlock detection and recovery strategy versus the productivity losses experienced under this approach due to increased system blocking, and/or additional material handling overheads. It turns out that, for the considered system configuration, the optimal selection scheme switches between detection and recovery and pure deadlock avoidance, every time that the time cost of deadlock recovery, tau(d), crosses a threshold Theta, which is a function of the remaining system behavioral and timing parameters, Beyond its own theoretical merit, this last result raises also the question of whether the policy randomization introduced in this work will ever enhance the performance of any configuration in the considered class of Resource Allocation Systems (RAS); this issue will be investigated in a sequel paper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,,,,,OCT,2000,30,5,,,,,799,811,,10.1109/3477.875453,0.0,,,,,,,,18252410.0,,,,,WOS:000089820700014,0

Support vector machines (SVMs) are a subset of kernel machines and generalize well for classification, regression, and anomaly detection tasks. The training procedure for traditional SVMs involves solving a quadratic programming (QP) problem. The QP problem scales super linearly in computational effort with the number of training samples and is often used for the offline batch processing of data. Kernel machines operate by retaining a subset of observed data during training. The data vectors contained within this subset are referred to as support vectors (SVs). The work presented in this paper introduces a subset selection method for the use of kernel machines in online, changing environments. Our algorithm works by using a stochastic indexing technique when selecting a subset of SVs when computing the kernel expansion. The work described here is novel because it separates the selection of kernel basis functions from the training algorithm used. The subset selection algorithm presented here can be used in conjunction with any online training technique. It is important for online kernel machines to be computationally efficient due to the real-time requirements of online environments. Our algorithm is an important contribution because it scales linearly with the number of training samples and is compatible with current training techniques.

In this paper, we use the manifold regularization approach to formulate the semisupervised learning problem where a regularization framework which balances a tradeoff between loss and penalty is established. We investigate different implementations of the loss function and identify the methods which have the least computational expense. The regularization hyperparameter, which determines the balance between loss and penalty, is crucial to model selection.

In general, it is difficult to adopt a model-based design to achieve this control objective due to the uncertainties in practical applications, such as friction forces, external disturbances, and parameter variations. In order to cope with this problem, an indirect AFNNC (IAFNNC) scheme and a direct AFNNC (DAFNNC) strategy are investigated without the requirement of prior system information. In these model-free control topologies, a continuous-time Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) dynamic fuzzy model with online learning ability is constructed to represent the system dynamics of an n-link robot manipulator. In the IAFNNC, an FNN estimator is designed to time the nonlinear dynamic function vector in fuzzy local models, and then, the estimative vector is used to indirectly develop a stable IAFNNC law. In the DAFNNC, an FNN controller is directly designed to imitate a predetermined model-based stabilizing control law, and then, the stable control performance can be achieved by only using joint position information. All the IAFNNC and DAFNNC laws and the corresponding adaptive tuning algorithms for FNN weights are established in the sense of Lyapunov stability analyses to ensure the stable control performance.

In classification problems, optimal values of k are usually estimated by minimizing the cross-validated misclassification rates. However, these cross-validation techniques allow only one value of k for each population density estimate, while in a classification problem, the optimum value of k for a class may also depend on its competing population densities. Further, it is computationally difficult to minimize the cross-validated error rate when there are several competing populations. Moreover, in addition to depending on the entire training data set, a good choice of k should also depend on the specific observation to be classified. Therefore, instead of using a single value of k for each population density estimate, it is more useful in practice to consider the results for multiple values of k to arrive at the final decision. This paper presents one such approach along with a graphical device, which gives more information about classification results for various choices of k and the related statistical uncertainties present there.

Isomap is one of the most promising nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques. However, when Isomap is applied to real-world data, it shows some limitations, such as being sensitive to noise. In this paper, an improved version of Isomap, namely S-Isomap, is proposed. S-Isomap utilizes class information to guide the procedure of nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Such a kind of procedure is called supervised nonlinear dimensionality reduction. In S-Isomap, the neighborhood graph of the input data is constructed according to a certain kind of dissimilarity between data points, which is specially designed to integrate the class information. The dissimilarity has several good properties which help to discover the true neighborhood of the data and, thus, makes S-Isomap a robust technique for both visualization and classification, especially for real-world problems.

At the tangent frequency, the Nyquist curve tangentially touches the sensitivity circle. Several relay feedback tests are used to identify the plant gain and phase at the tangent frequency in an iterative way. The identified plant gain and phase at the desired tangent frequency are used to estimate the derivatives of amplitude and phase of the plant with respect to frequency at the same frequency point by Bode's integral relationship. Then these derivatives are used to design a PID controller for slope adjustment of the Nyquist plot to achieve the robustness of the system to gain variations.

It is usually carried out through an iterative cycle of behavior prediction, conflict detection, candidate generation, and candidate refinement. In that process conflict detection has proven to be a nontrivial step from the theoretical point of view. For this reason, many approaches to consistency-based diagnosis have relied upon some kind of dependency-recording. These techniques have had different problems, specially when they were applied to diagnose dynamic systems. Recently, offline dependency compilation has established itself as a suitable alternative approach to online dependency- recording. In this paper we propose the possible conflict concept as a compilation technique for consistency- based diagnosis. Each possible conflict represents a subsystem within system description containing minimal analytical redundancy and being capable to become a conflict. Moreover, the whole set of possible conflicts can be computed offline with no model evaluation. Once we have formalized the possible. conflict concept, we explain how possible conflicts can be used in the consistency-based diagnosis framework, and how this concept can be easily extended to diagnose dynamic systems. Finally, we analyze its relation to conflicts in the general diagnosis engine (GDE) framework and compare possible conflicts with other compilation techniques, especially with analytical redundancy relations (ARRs) obtained through structural analysis.

The perception process produces an expectation of the next set of information to be received from the system. The expectation is used to replace missing parts of the information received and it also influences the next perception. In the existing work, each of the expectation elements is linearly acquired such that the expectation tells only the dominant information in the recent past, i.e., this approach has no capability to sense the trend and the dynamics in the information. This handicap could become a serious problem when the perception process is applied to real physical systems. Here, we introduce an extension of the perception control process by using a radial basis function (RBF) feedforward NN to learn the trend and the dynamics in the information and produce the expectation of the next observation.

The study of the orthogonal sums of affine subspaces allows us to unveil a convex decomposition of Dempster's rule of combination in terms of Bayes' rule of conditioning and prove that under specific conditions orthogonal sum and affine closure commute.

Metaheuristics can be seen as the result of the interaction among different kinds of agents: The basic architecture contains three levels, each hosting one or more agents. Level-0 agents build solutions, level-1 agents improve solutions, and level-2 agents provide the high level strategy. In this framework, classical metaheuristic algorithms can be smoothly accommodated and extended. The basic three level architecture can be enhanced with the introduction of a fourth level of agents (level-3 agents) coordinating lower level agents. With this additional level, MAGMA can also describe, in a uniform way, cooperative search and, in general, any combination of metaheuristics. We describe the entire architecture, the structure of agents in each level in terms of tuples, and the structure of their coordination as a labeled transition system. We propose this perspective with the aim to achieve a better and clearer understanding of metaheuristics, obtain hybrid algorithms, suggest guidelines for a software engineering-oriented implementation and for didactic purposes. Some specializations of the general architecture will be provided in order to show that existing metaheuristics [e.g., greedy randomized adaptive procedure (GRASP), ant colony optimization (ACO), iterated local search (ILS), memetic algorithms (MAs)] can be easily described in our framework.

All that is needed is the probability density function (PDF) of each sufficient statistic under its own assumed model-presumably this comes from training data, and it is particularly appealing that there is no need at all for a joint statistical characterization of all the statistics. There is similarly no need for an a-priori specification of the number of sections, as the approach uses an appropriate penalization of an over-zealous segmentation. The scheme has two stages. In stage one, rough segmentations are implemented sequentially using a piecewise generalized likelihood ratio (GLR); in the second stage, the results from the first stage (both forward and backward) are refined. The computational burden is remarkably small, approximately linear with the length of the time series, and the method is nicely accurate in terms both of discovered number of segments and of segmentation accuracy.

Apart from the definition of a dynamic modeling problem, another key issue is how to solve the problem. Because of the complexity of the representations, currently the finite element method or finite difference method is usually used. Their major shortcoming is the excessive computational cost, hence not ideal for applications requiring real-time performance.

Two single-row laser range scanners are mounted on the roof of a vehicle, doing horizontal and vertical profiling respectively. As the vehicle moves ahead, a horizontal and a vertical range profile of the surroundings are captured at each odometer trigger. The freedom of vehicle motion is reduced from six to three by assuming that the ground surface is flat and smooth so resulting in the vehicle moving on almost the same horizontal plane. Horizontal range profiles, which have an overwhelming overlay between successive ones, are registered to trace vehicle location and attitude. Vertical range profiles are aligned to the coordinate system of the horizontal one according to the physical geometry between the pair of laser range scanners, and subsequently to a global coordinate system to make up 3-D data. An experiment is conducted where 3-D data of a real urban scene is obtained by registering and integrating 2412 horizontal and vertical range profiles. Two ground truths are used in examination. They are the outputs of a GPS/INS/Odometer based positioning system and a 1:500 digital map of the testing site.

Competitive learning based on a vitality conservation principle is near-optimum, in the sense that problem of trapping in a local minimum is alleviated by adding perturbations to the learning rate during node generation processes. Combined with a procedure that redistributes the learning rate variables after generation and removal of nodes, the competitive conservation strategy provides a novel approach to the problem of harmonizing equi-error and equi probable criteria. The training process is smooth and incremental, it not only achieves the biologically plausible learning property, but also facilitates systematic derivations for training parameters.

To this end, a special class of artificial neural networks, namely, self-organizing maps (SOMs), is employed for obtaining a superquadric-based model of the human. The SOM network receives information of the human's footprints from the sensory system and infers necessary data for rendering the human model. The model is then used in order to assess the danger of the robot operations based on the measured as well as predicted human motions. This is followed by the introduction of a new reactive control scheme that results in the least interferences between the human and robot operations.

The proposed attention model involves seven modules: learning of object representations stored in a long-term memory (LTM), preattentive processing, top-down biasing, bottom-up competition, mediation between top-down and bottom-up ways, generation of saliency maps, and perceptual completion processing. It works in two phases: learning phase and attending phase. In the learning phase, the corresponding object representation is trained statistically when one object is attended. A dual-coding object representation consisting of local and global codings is proposed. Intensity, color, and orientation features are used to build the local coding, and a contour feature is employed to constitute the global coding. In the attending phase, the model preattentively segments the visual field into discrete proto-objects using Gestalt rules at first. If a task-specific object is given, the model recalls the corresponding representation from LTM and deduces the task-relevant feature(s) to evaluate top-down biases. The mediation between automatic bottom-up competition and conscious top-down biasing is then performed to yield a location-based saliency map. By combination of location-based saliency within each proto-object, the proto-object-based saliency is evaluated. The most salient proto-object is selected for attention, and it is finally put into the perceptual completion processing module to yield a complete object region.

Understanding these networks is a key to understand the dynamics of real and artificial systems. Network motifs are small graphs-usually three to four nodes-representing local structures. They have been widely used in studying complex systems and in characterizing features on the system level by analyzing locally how the substructures are formed. Frequencies of different network motifs have been shown in the literature to vary from one network to another, and conclusions hypothesized that these variations are due to the evolution/dynamics of the system. In this paper, we show for the first time that in strategy games, each game (i.e., type of dynamism) has its own signature of motifs and that this signature is maintained during the evolution of the game.

By incorporating the advantages of the mean shift (MS) segmentation and the normalized cut (Ncut) partitioning methods, the proposed method requires low computational complexity and is therefore very feasible for real-time image segmentation processing. It preprocesses an image by using the MS algorithm to form segmented regions that preserve the desirable discontinuity characteristics of the image. The segmented regions are then represented by using the graph structures, and the Ncut method is applied to perform globally optimized clustering. Because the number of the segmented regions is much smaller than that of the image pixels, the proposed method allows a low-dimensional image clustering with significant reduction of the complexity compared to conventional graph-partitioning methods that are directly applied to the image pixels. In addition, the image clustering using the segmented regions, instead of the image pixels, also reduces the sensitivity to noise and results in enhanced image segmentation performance. Furthermore, to avoid some inappropriate partitioning when considering every region as only one graph node, we develop an improved segmentation strategy using multiple child nodes for each region.

To overcome these problems, we propose a method of rank-one projections with adaptive margins (RPAM) that gives a provably convergent solution for tensor data over a more general class of projections, while accounting for margins between samples of different classes. In contrast to previous margin-based works which determine margin sample pairs within the original high dimensional feature space, RPAM aims instead to maximize the margins defined in the expected lower dimensional feature subspace by progressive margin refinement after each rank-one projection. In addition to handling tensor data, vector-based variants of RPAM are presented for linear mappings and for nonlinear mappings using kernel tricks.

A teacher demonstrates a desired movement in front of a camera, and then, the robot is tasked to replay it by repetitive tracking. The imitation procedure is considered as a discrete tracking control problem in the image plane, with an unknown and time-varying image Jacobian matrix. Instead of updating the control signal directly, as is usually done in iterative learning control (ILC), a series of neural networks are used to approximate the unknown Jacobian matrix around every sample point in the demonstrated trajectory, and the time-varying weights of local neural networks are identified through repetitive tracking, i.e., indirect ILC. This makes repetitive segmented training possible, and a segmented training strategy is presented to retain the training trajectories solely within the effective region for neural network approximation. However, a singularity problem may occur if an unmodified neural-network-based Jacobian estimation is used to calculate the robot end-effector velocity. A new weight modification algorithm is proposed which ensures invertibility of the estimation, thus circumventing the problem.

We extend it by introducing a GA at the source routers, which modifies and filters the paths discovered by the CPN. The GA can combine the paths that were previously discovered to create new untested but valid source-to-destination paths, which are then selected on the basis of their fitness. We present an implementation of this approach, where the GA runs in background mode so as not to overload the ingress routers. Measurements conducted on a network test bed indicate that when the background-traffic load of the network is light to medium, the GA can result in improved QoS.

MDAs are e-negotiation agents designed with the flexibility of: 1) making adjustable amounts of concession taking into account market rivalry, outside options, and time preferences and 2) relaxing bargaining terms in the face of intense pressure. A heterogeneous testbed consisting of several types of e-negotiation agents to simulate a Grid computing environment was developed. It compares the performance of MDAs against other e-negotiation agents (e.g., Kasbah) in a Grid-commerce environment. Empirical results show that MDAs generally achieve: 1) higher budget efficiencies in many market situations than other e-negotiation agents in the testbed and 2) higher success rates in acquiring Grid resources under high Grid loadings.",,,,,,"Sim, Kwang Mong/0000-0001-8618-2957",,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,DEC,2006,36,6,,,,,1381,1394,,10.1109/TSMCB.2006.877791,0.0,,,,,,,,17186814.0,,,,,WOS:000242690600019,0

The stability of the overall system is guaranteed by a version of the input-to-output stable small-gain theorem for functional differential equations.

According to their characteristics, several behaviors are designed for agents by making use of the ability of agents to sense and act on the environment. These behaviors are controlled by means of evolution, so that the multiagent evolutionary algorithm for constraint satisfaction problems (MAEA-CSPs) results. To overcome the disadvantages of the general encoding methods, the minimum conflict encoding is also proposed. Theoretical analyzes show that MAEA-CSPs has a linear space complexity and converges to the global optimum. The first part of the experiments uses 250 benchmark binary CSPs and 79 graph coloring problems from the DIMACS challenge to test the performance of MAEA-CSPs for nonpermutation CSPs. MAEA-CSPs is compared with six well-defined algorithms and the effect of the parameters is analyzed systematically. The second part of the experiments uses a classical CSP, n-queen problems, and a more practical case, job-shop scheduling problems (JSPs), to test the performance of MAEA-CSPs for permutation CSPs. The scalability of MAEA-CSPs along n for n-queen problems is studied with great care. The results show that MAEA-CSPs achieves good performance when n increases from 10(4) to 10 (7), and has a linear time complexity.

An adaptive fuzzy system modeled these bruise patterns based on the depth and width of the deformed armor given a projectile's mass and momentum. The fuzzy system used rules with sinc-shaped if-part fuzzy sets and was robust against random rule pruning: Median and mean test errors remained low even after removing up to one fifth of the rules. Handguns shot different caliber bullets at armor that had a 10%-ordnance gelatin backing. The gelatin blocks were tissue simulants. The gunshot data tuned the additive fuzzy function approximator. The fuzzy system's conditional variance V[Y vertical bar X = x] described the second-order uncertainty of the function approximation. Handguns with different barrel lengths shot bullets over a fixed distance at armor-clad gelatin blocks that we made with Type 250 A Ordnance Gelatin. The bullet-armor experiments found that a bullet's weight and momentum correlated with the depth of its impact on armor-clad gelatin (R-2 = 0.881 and p-value < 0.001 for the null hypothesis that the regression line had zero slope). Related experiments on plumber's putty showed that highspeed baseball impacts compared well to bullet-armor impacts for large-caliber handguns. A baseball's momentum correlated with its impact depth in putty (R-2 = 0.93 and p-value < 0.001). A bullet's momentum similarly correlated with its armor-impact in putty (R-2 = 0.97 and p-value < 0.001). A Gujarati-Chow test showed that the two putty-impact regression lines had statistically indistinguishable slopes for p-value = 0.396. Baseball impact depths were comparable to bullet-armor impact depths: Getting shot with a .22 caliber bullet when wearing soft body armor resembles getting hit in the chest with a 40-mph baseball.

Since the use of more accurate 3-D range imaging equipment has become more popular, as well as the use of polyhedral meshes to approximate surfaces, evaluation of existing algorithms for curvature estimation is again relevant. The work presented here, makes some subtle but very important modifications to two such algorithms, originally suggested by Taubin [17] and Chen and Schmitt [2]. The algorithms have been adjusted to deal with real discrete noisy range data, given as a cloud of sampled points, lying on surfaces of free-form objects. The results of this linear time (and space) complexity implementation were evaluated in a series of tests on synthetic and real input. We also present one of many possible uses for these extracted features in an efficient and robust application for the recovery of 3-D geometric primitives from range data of complex scenes. The application combines the segmentation, classification and fitting processes in a single process which advances monotonously through the recovery procedure. It is also very robust and does not use any least-squares fittings.

In this paper, we investigate necessary conditions for general multiple-input single-output (MISO) Mamdani fuzzy systems as universal approximators with as minimal system configuration as possible. The general MISO fuzzy systems employ almost arbitrary continuous input fuzzy sets, arbitrary singleton output fuzzy sets, arbitrary fuzzy rules, product fuzzy logic AND, and the generalized defuzzifier containing the popular centroid defuzzifier as a special case. Our necessary conditions are developed under the practically sensible assumption that only a finite set of extrema of the multivariate continuous function to be approximated is available. We have first revealed a decomposition property of the general fuzzy systems: A tau -input fuzzy system can always be decomposed to the sum of tau simpler fuzzy systems where the first system has only one input variable, the second one two input variables, and the last one tau input variables. Utilizing this property, we have derived some necessary conditions for the fuzzy systems to be universal approximators with minimal system configuration. The conditions expose the strength as well as limitation of the fuzzy approximation: 1) only a small number of fuzzy rules may be needed to uniformly approximate multivariate continuous functions that have a complicated formulation but a relatively small number of extrema; and 2) the number of fuzzy rules must be large in order to approximate highly oscillatory continuous functions, A numerical example is given to demonstrate our new results,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,,,,,DEC,2000,30,6,,,,,857,864,,,,,,,,,,,18252416.0,,,,,WOS:000165708400004,0

The term real-world refers to systems under computer control that relate to everyday life and are beneficial to the society in the large. The traditional approach to such problems consists of designing a central entity which collects all data, executes a decision-making algorithm sequentially to yield the decisions, and propagates the decisions to the respective sites. Centralized derision-making algorithms are slow and highly vulnerable to natural and artificial catastrophes. Recent literature includes successful asynchronous, distributed, decision-making algorithm designs wherein the local decision making at every site replaces the centralized decision making to achieve faster response, higher reliability, and greater accuracy of the decisions. Two key issues include 1) the lack of an approach to synthesize asynchronous, distributed, decision-making algorithms, for any globally optimal. In truth, however, as the frequency of the sensor data given problem, and 2) the absence of a comparative analysis of the quality of their decisions. This paper proposes MFAD, a Mathematical Framework for Asynchronous Distributed Systems, that permits the description of centralized decision-making algorithms and facilities the synthesis of distributed decision-making algorithms. MFAD is based on the Kohn-Nerode distributed hybrid control paradigm. It has been a belief that since the centralized control gathers every necessary data from all entities in the system and utilizes them to compute the decisions, the decisions may be increases and the environment gets larger, dynamic, and more complex, the decisions are called into question. In the distributed decision-making system, the centralized decision-making is replaced by those of the constituent entities that aim at minimizing a Lagrangian, i.e,, a local, nonnegative cost criterion, subject to the constraints imposed by the global goal. Thus, computations are carried out locally, utilizing locally obtained data and appropriate information that is propagated from other sites. It is hypothesized that with each entity engaged in optimizing its individual behavior, asynchronously, concurrently, and independent of other entities, the distributed system will approach global optimal behavior While it does not claim that such algorithms may be synthesized for all centralized real-world systems, this paper implements both the centralized and distributed paradigms for a representative military battlefield command, control, and communication (C-3) problem. It also simulates them on a testbed of a network of workstations for a comparative performance evaluation of the centralized and decentralized paradigms in the MFAD framework. While the performance results indicate that the decentralized approach consistently outperforms the centralized scheme, this paper aims at developing a quantitative evaluation of the quality of decisions under the decentralized paradigm. To achieve this goal, it introduces a fundamental concept, embodied through a hypothetical entity termed Perfect Global Optimization Device (PGOD), that generates perfect or ideal decisions. PGOD possesses perfect knowledge, i.e., the exact state information of every entity of the entire system, at all times, unaffected by delay. PGOD utilizes the same decision-making algorithm as the centralized paradigm and generates perfect globally-optimal decisions which, though unattainable, provide a fundamental and absolute basis for comparing the quality of decisions. Simulation results reveal that the quality of decisions in the decentralized paradigm are superior to those of the centralized approach and that they approach PGOD's decisions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,FEB,2000,30,1,,,,,229,239,,10.1109/3477.826966,0.0,,,,,,,,18244748.0,,,,,WOS:000086068000025,0

Hence, the NFC can combine low-level controllers and achieve multiple objectives (goals) at once. The NFC acts like a switch that chooses a proper action from the actions of low-level controllers according to the feedback information from the environment. In fact, the NFC is a soft switch; it allows more than one low-level actions to be active with different degrees through fuzzy combination at each time step, An NFC can be designed by the trial-and-error approach if enough a priori knowledge is available, or it can be obtained by supervised learning if precise input/output training data are available. In the more practical cases when there is no instructive teaching information available, the NFC can learn by itself using the proposed reinforcement learning scheme. Adopted with reinforcement learning capability, the NFC can learn to achieve desired multiobjectives simultaneously through the rough reinforcement feedback from the environment, which contains only critic information such as success (good) or failure (bad) for each desired objective.

The proposed SOS-based framework provides a number of innovations and improvements over the existing linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based approaches to Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy controller and observer designs. First, we briefly summarize previous results with respect to a polynomial fuzzy system that is a more general representation of the well-known T-S fuzzy system. Next, we propose polynomial fuzzy observers to estimate states in three classes of polynomial fuzzy systems and derive SOS conditions to design polynomial fuzzy controllers and observers. A remarkable feature of the SOS design conditions for the first two classes (Classes I and II) is that they realize the so-called separation principle, i.e., the polynomial fuzzy controller and observer for each class can be separately designed without lack of guaranteeing the stability of the overall control system in addition to converging state-estimation error (via the observer) to zero. Although, for the last class (Class III), the separation principle does not hold, we propose an algorithm to design polynomial fuzzy controller and observer satisfying the stability of the overall control system in addition to converging state-estimation error (via the observer) to zero. All the design conditions in the proposed approach can be represented in terms of SOS and are symbolically and numerically solved via the recently developed SOSTOOLS and a semidefinite-program solver, respectively.

These systems may use hidden Markov models (HMMs) in two different modes: user-specific HMM (US-HMM) and user-adapted universal background models (UBMs) (UA-UBMs). Verification scores can be obtained from likelihood ratios and a distance measure on the Viterbi decoded state sequences. This paper analyzes several factors that can modify the behavior of these systems and which have not been deeply studied yet. First, we study the influence of the feature set choice, paying special attention to the role of dynamic information order, suitability of feature sets on each kind of generative model-based system, and the importance of inclination angles and pressure. Moreover, this analysis is also extended to the influence of the HMM complexity in the performance of the different approaches. For this study, a set of experiments is performed on the publicly available MCYT-100 database using only skilled forgeries. These experiments provide interesting outcomes. First, the Viterbi path evidences a notable stability for most of the feature sets and systems. Second, in the case of US-HMM systems, likelihood evidence obtains better results when lowest order dynamics are included in the feature set, while likelihood ratio obtains better results in UA-UBM systems when lowest dynamics are not included in the feature set.

A two-stage fuzzy-random facility-location model with recourse (FR-FLMR) is developed in which both the demands and costs are assumed to be fuzzy-random variables. The bounds of the optimal objective value of the two-stage FR-FLMR are derived. As, in general, the fuzzy-random parameters of the FR-FLMR can be regarded as continuous fuzzy-random variables with an infinite number of realizations, the computation of the recourse requires solving infinite second-stage programming problems. Owing to this requirement, the recourse function cannot be determined analytically, and, hence, the model cannot benefit from the use of techniques of classical mathematical programming. In order to solve the location problems of this nature, we first develop a technique of fuzzy-random simulation to compute the recourse function. The convergence of such simulation scenarios is discussed. In the sequel, we propose a hybrid mutation-based binary ant-colony optimization (MBACO) approach to the two-stage FR-FLMR, which comprises the fuzzy-random simulation and the simplex algorithm.

For haptic teleoperation, in addition to a haptics-capable master interface, often one or more force sensors are also used, which warrant new bilateral control architectures while increasing the cost and the complexity of the teleoperation system. In this paper, we investigate the added benefits of using force sensors that measure hand/master and slave/environment interactions and of utilizing local feedback loops on the teleoperation transparency. We compare the two-channel and the four-channel bilateral control systems in terms of stability and transparency, and study the stability and performance robustness of the four-channel method against nonidealities that arise during bilateral control implementation, which include master-slave communication latency and changes in the environment dynamics. The next issue addressed in the paper deals with the case where the master interface is not haptics capable, but the slave is equipped with a force sensor. In the context of robotics-assisted soft-tissue surgical applications, we explore through human factors experiments whether slave/environment force measurements can be of any help with regard to improving task performance.

The method is intended to enhance pattern recognition performance by creating new neural architectures specifically tuned for a particular pattern recognition problem. It is proposed a combined neural architecture composed of two networks in cascade: a feature extraction network (FEN) followed by a neural classifier. The FEN is composed of several layers with receptive fields constructed by an additive superposition of excitatory and inhibitory fields. A genetic algorithm (GA) is used to select the receptive fields parameters to improve the classification performance. The parameters are the receptive field, size, orientation, and bias as well as the number of different receptive fields in each layer. Based on a random initial population where each individual represents a different neural architecture, the GA creates new enhanced individuals. The method is applied to the problems of handwritten digit classification and face recognition. In both problems, results show strong dependency between the NN classification performance and the receptive fields architecture. The GA selected parameters of the receptive fields that produced improvements in the classification. performance on the test set up to 90.8% for the problem of handwritten digit classification and up to 84.2% for the face recognition problem.

The center of the polygon formed by the contact points at the end of the LP is to be used as the ZMP when the trajectory, for the next step is generated.

However, the RPCL algorithm was proposed heuristically and is still in lack of a mathematical theory to describe its convergence behavior. In order to solve the convergence problem, we investigate it via a cost-function approach. By theoretical analysis, we prove that a general form of RPCL, called distance-sensitive RPCL (DSRPCL), is associated with the minimization of a cost function on the weight vectors of a competitive learning network. As a DSRPCL process decreases the cost to a local minimum, a number of weight vectors eventually fall into a hypersphere surrounding the sample data, while the other weight vectors diverge to infinity. Moreover, it is shown by the theoretical analysis and simulation experiments that if the cost reduces into the global minimum, a correct number of weight vectors is automatically selected and located around the centers of the actual clusters, respectively.

Especially for vision networks classifying three-dimensional (3-D) objects this problem is very challenging, as these networks are necessarily large and therefore the search space for defining the needed networks is of a very high dimensionality. This strongly increases the chances of obtaining only suboptimal structures from standard optimization algorithms. We tackle this problem in two ways. First, we use biologically inspired hierarchical vision models to narrow the space of possible architectures and to reduce the dimensionality of the search space. Second, we employ evolutionary optimization techniques to determine optimal features and nonlinearities of the visual hierarchy. Here, we especially focus on higher order complex features in higher hierarchical stages. We compare two different approaches to perform an evolutionary optimization of these features. In the first setting, we directly code the features into the genome. In the second setting, in analogy to an ontogenetical development process, we suggest the new method of an indirect coding of the features via an unsupervised learning process, which is embedded into the evolutionary optimization. In both cases the processing nonlinearities are encoded directly into the genome and are thus subject to optimization. The fitness of the individuals for the evolutionary selection process is computed by measuring the network classification performance on a benchmark image database. Here, we use a nearest-neighbor classification approach, based on the hierarchical feature output. We compare the found solutions with respect to their ability to generalize. We differentiate between a first-and a second-order generalization. The first-order generalization denotes how well the vision system, after evolutionary optimization of the features and nonlinearities using a database A, can classify previously unseen test views of objects from this database A. As second-order generalization, we denote the ability of the vision system to perform classification on a database B using the features and nonlinearities optimized on database A. We show that the direct feature coding approach leads to networks with a better first-order generalization, whereas the second-order generalization is on an equally high level for both direct and indirect coding. We also compare the second-order generalization results with other state-of-the-art recognition systems and show that both approaches lead to optimized recognition systems, which are highly competitive with recent recognition algorithms.",,,,,"Sendhoff, Bernhard/AAW-6486-2020","Sendhoff, Bernhard/0000-0002-1233-9584",,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,JUN,2005,35,3,,,,,426,437,,10.1109/TSMCB.2005.846649,0.0,,,,,,,,15971912.0,,,,,WOS:000229309700005,0

We discuss the benefits coming with this new framework. The benefits are twofold. On the theoretical side, the new framework allows us to prove that in Ant System, the ancestor of all ant colony optimization algorithms, the average quality of the solutions produced increases in expectation over time when applied to unconstrained problems.

The largely graph-based current framework of the crisp DES is unsuitable for the expansion and we have thus reformulated it using state vectors and event transition matrices which can be extended to fuzzy vectors and matrices by allowing their elements to take values between 0 and 1. To measure information related to fuzzy DES, we generalize the crisp DES observability. The new observability allows one to determine whether or not the system output observed is sufficient for decision making. Finally, we extend optimal control of DES to fuzzy DES. The new fuzzy DES theory is consistent with the existing theory, both at conceptual and computation levels, in that the former contains the latter as a special case when the memberships must be either 0 or 1.

Multiagent systems are highly connected, and the information they contain is mostly stored in the connections. When agents update their state, they take into account the state of the other agents, and they have access to those states via the connections. There is also external user-generated input into the multiagent system. As so much information is stored in the connections, agents are often memory less. This memory-less property, together with the randomness of the external input, has allowed us to model multiagent systems using Markov chains. In this paper, we look at multiagent systems that evolve, i.e., the number of agents varies according to the fitness of the individual agents. We extend our Markov chain model and define stability. This is the start of a methodology to control multiagent systems. We then build upon this to construct an entropy-based definition for the degree of instability (entropy of the limit probabilities), which we used to perform a stability analysis. We then investigated the stability of evolving agent populations through simulation and show that the results are consistent with the original definition of stability in nonevolving multiagent systems, proposed by Chli and De Wilde.

Unlike most previous studies, AMGA puts emphasis on autonomous functioning in the design process of ANNs. This is the main reason why AMGA uses an adaptive not a predefined fixed strategy in designing ANNs. The adaptive strategy merges or adds hidden neurons based on the learning ability of hidden neurons or the training progress of ANNs. In order to reduce the amount of retraining after modifying ANN architectures, AMGA prunes hidden neurons by merging correlated hidden neurons and adds hidden neurons by splitting existing hidden neurons. The proposed AMGA has been tested on a number of benchmark problems in machine learning and ANNs, including breast cancer, Australian credit card assessment, and diabetes, gene, glass, heart, iris, and thyroid problems.

In the proposed approach, we first map these problems onto the maximum clique-finding problem (MCP), which is later solved using an evolutionary strategy. The proposed impatient EA with probabilistic tabu search (IEA-PTS) for the MCP integrates the best features of earlier successful approaches with a number of new heuristics that we developed to yield a performance that advances the state of the art in EAs for the exploration of the maximum cliques in a graph. Results of experimentation with the 37 DIMACS benchmark graphs and comparative analyses with six state-of-the-art algorithms, including two from the smaller EA community and four from the larger metaheuristics community, indicate that the IEA-PTS outperforms the EAs with respect to a Pareto-lexicographic ranking criterion and offers competitive performance on some graph instances when individually compared to the other heuristic algorithms.

In this paper, we propose the alpha-cut implemented fuzzy clustering algorithms, referred to as FCM alpha, which allow the data points being able to completely belong to one cluster. The proposed FCMa algorithms can form a cluster core for each cluster, where data points inside a cluster core will have a membership value of I so that it can resolve the drawbacks of FCM. On the other hand, the fuzziness index m plays different roles for FCM and FCM alpha. We find that the clustering results obtained by FCM alpha are more robust to noise and outliers than FCM when a larger m is used. Moreover, the cluster cores generated by FCM alpha are workable for various data shape clusters, so that FCMa is very suitable for embedding into switching regressions.

Since recognizing faces is a task that humans are understood to be very good at, it is common to want to compare automatic face recognition (AFR) and human face recognition (HFR) in terms of biometric performance. This paper addresses this question by: 1) conducting verification tests on volunteers (HFR) and commercial AFR systems and 2) developing statistical methods to support comparison of the performance of different biometric systems. HFR was tested by presenting face-image pairs and asking subjects to classify them on a scale of Same, Probably Same, Not sure, Probably Different, and Different; the same image pairs were presented to AFR systems, and the biometric match score was measured. To evaluate these results, two new statistical evaluation techniques are developed. The first is a new way to normalize match-score distributions, where a normalized match score (t) over cap is calculated as a function of the angle from a representation of [false match rate, false nonmatch rate] values in polar coordinates from some center. Using this normalization, we develop a second methodology to calculate an average detection error tradeoff (DET) curve and show that this method is equivalent to direct averaging of DET data along each angle from the center. This procedure is then applied to compare the performance of the best AFR algorithms available to us in the years 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2006, in comparison to human scores.

The criteria have two features: 1) the behavior of the two successive states of the system is considered in the inequalities and 2) the interactions among the fuzzy subsystems in each subregion S-j are presented by one matrix X-j.

Previous works have included latency as part of the routing goal of smart packets, which requires packets to collect their arrival time at each node in a path. Such a requirement resulted in a packet overhead proportional to the path length. The second problem is that the multiplicative form of path availability, which was employed to measure resources, loses accuracy in long paths. To solve these problems, new goals are proposed in this paper. These goals are linear functions of low-overhead metrics and can provide similar performance results with lower cost. One direct result shown in simulation is that smart packets driven by a linear function of path length and buffer occupancy can effectively balance the traffic of multiple flows without the large overhead that would be needed if round-trip delay was used. In addition, energy-aware routing is also studied under this scheme as well as link selection based on their expected level of security.",,,,,,"Lent, Ricardo/0000-0003-4884-3456",,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,DEC,2006,36,6,,,,,1255,1260,,10.1109/TSMCB.2006.873212,0.0,,,,,,,,17186802.0,,,,,WOS:000242690600007,0

While much research has been published, both in the biomechanics and engineering fields regarding the analysis of these gaits, no single study has adequately characterized the dynamics of high-speed running as can be achieved in a realistic, yet simple, robotic system. The goal of this paper is to find the most energy-efficient, natural, and unconstrained gallop that can be achieved using a simulated quadrupedal robot with articulated legs, asymmetric mass distribution, and compliant legs. For comparison purposes, we also implement the bound and canter. The model used here is planar, although we will show that it captures much of the predominant dynamic characteristics observed in animals. While it is not our goal to prove anything about biological locomotion, the dynamic similarities between the gaits we produce and those found in animals does indicate a similar underlying dynamic mechanism. Thus, we will show that achieving natural, efficient high-speed locomotion is possible even with a fairly simple robotic system. To generate the high-speed gaits, we use an efficient evolutionary algorithm called set-based stochastic optimization. This algorithm rinds open-loop control parameters to generate periodic trajectories for the body. Several alternative methods are tested to generate periodic trajectories for the legs.

Such systems generally offer significant advantages over the traditional, centralized algorithms in the form of concurrency, scalability, high throughput, efficiency, low vulnerability to catastrophic failures, and robustness. A fundamental property of ADDM systems is stability that refers to their behavior under representative perturbations to their operating environments, given that such systems are intended to be real, complex, and to some extent, mission-critical, and are subject to unexpected changes in their operating conditions. This paper introduces the concept of stability in ADDM systems and proposes an intuitive yet practical and usable definition that is inspired by those used in control systems and physics. An ADDM system is defined as a stable system if it returns to a steady state in finite time, following perturbation, provided that it is initiated in a steady state. Equilibrium or steady state is defined through placing bounds on the measured error in the system. Where the final steady state is equivalent to the initial one, a system is referred to as strongly stable, If the final steady state is potentially worse then the initial one, a system is deemed marginally stable. When a system fails to return to steady state following the perturbation, it is unstable. The perturbations are classified as either changes in the input pattern or changes in one or more environmental characteristics of the system, such as hardware failures. For a given ADDM system, the definitions are based on the performance indices that must be judiciously identified by the system architect and are likely to be unique. To facilitate the understanding of stability in representative real-world systems, this paper reports the analysis of two basic manifestations of ADDM systems that have been reported in the literature: 1) a decentralized military command and control problem, MEAD and 2) a novel distributed algorithm with soft reservation for efficient scheduling and congestion mitigation in railway networks, RYNSORD, Stability analysis of MFAD and RYNSORD yields key stable and unstable conditions. A system determined to be stable provides the reassurance that the system will perform well under adverse conditions. In contrast, a system deemed unstable reflects the need to address key weaknesses in the system design.

Moreover, unlike traditional fuzzy controllers, which partition the input space into a grid, SEFC partitions the input space in a flexible way, thus creating fewer fuzzy rules. In SEFC, different types of fuzzy rules whose consequent parts are singletons, fuzzy sets, or linear equations (TSK-type fuzzy rules) are allowed. Further, the free parameters (e.g., centers and widths of membership functions) and fuzzy rules are all tuned automatically. For the TSK-type fuzzy rule especially, which put the proposed learning algorithm in use, only the significant input variables are selected to participate in the consequent of a rule. The proposed SEFC design method has been applied to different simulated control problems, including the cart-pole balancing system, a magnetic levitation system, and a water bath temperature control system. The proposed SEFC has been verified to be efficient and superior from these control problems, and from comparisons with some traditional GA-based fuzzy systems.",,,,,"Lin, Chin-Teng/G-8129-2017; Juang, Chia-Feng/A-8795-2008","Lin, Chin-Teng/0000-0001-8371-8197; Juang, Chia-Feng/0000-0002-3713-4315",,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,,,,,APR,2000,30,2,,,,,290,302,,10.1109/3477.836377,0.0,,,,,,,,18244755.0,,,,,WOS:000086532400004,0

Three significant characteristics of the local maximum modulus of the wavelet transform with respect to the Dirac-structure edges are presented: 1) slope invariant: the local maximum modulus of the wavelet transform of a Dirac-structure edge is independent on the slope of the edge; 2) grey-level invariant: the local maximum modulus of the wavelet transform with respect to a Dirac-structure edge takes place at the same points when the images with different grey-levels are processed; and 3) width light-dependent: for various widths of the Dirac-structure edge images, the location of maximum modulus of the wavelet transform varies lightly under the certain circumscription that the scale of the wavelet transform is larger than the width of the Dirac-structure edges. It is important, in practice, to select the suitable wavelet functions, according to the structures of edges. For example, Haar wavelet is better to represent brick-like images than other wavelets. A mapping technique is applied in this paper to construct such a wavelet function. In this way, a low-pass function is mapped onto a wavelet function by a derivation operation.

Without assistance, participants experienced multiple collisions while driving around the predefined route. Conversely, when they were assisted by the collaborative controller, not only did they drive more safely but also they were able to pay less attention to their driving, resulting in a reduced cognitive workload.

Instead of relying on human-guided variables, the aggregation behavior is determined in accordance with the underlying characteristics of the data being aggregated. Data-oriented operators such as the dependent OWA (DOWA) utilize centralized data structures to generate reliable weights, however. Despite their simplicity, the approach taken by these operators neglects entirely any local data structure that represents a strong agreement or consensus. To address this issue, the cluster-based OWA (Clus-DOWA) operator has been proposed. It employs a cluster-based reliability measure that is effective to differentiate the accountability of different input arguments. Yet, its actual application is constrained by the high computational requirement. This paper presents a more efficient nearest-neighbor-based reliability assessment for which an expensive clustering process is not required. The proposed measure can be perceived as a stress function, from which the OWA weights and associated decision-support explanations can be generated. To illustrate the potential of this measure, it is applied to both the problem of information aggregation for alias detection and the problem of unsupervised feature selection (in which unreliable features are excluded from an actual learning process).

The literature reports solutions in which the similarity constraint consists of a single index that is inappropriate for the type of multiconstraint problems considered here and where the constraints could simultaneously be contradictory. 1 Such a scenario is illustrated with the static mapping problem, which consists of distributing the processes of a parallel application onto a set of computing nodes. This is a classical and yet very important problem within the areas of parallel computing, grid computing, and cloud computing. We have developed four learning-automata (LA)-based algorithms to solve this problem: First, a fixed-structure stochastic automata algorithm is presented, where the processes try to form pairs to go onto the same node. This algorithm solves the problem, although it requires some centralized coordination. As it is desirable to avoid centralized control, we subsequently present three different variable-structure stochastic automata (VSSA) algorithms, which have superior partitioning properties in certain settings, although they forfeit some of the scalability features of the fixed-structure algorithm. All three VSSA algorithms model the processes as automata having first the hosting nodes as possible actions; second, the processes as possible actions; and, third, attempting to estimate the process communication digraph prior to probabilistically mapping the processes.

The most successful approaches of those are the extensions of the principal component analysis or the linear discriminant analysis. In the current paper, a new online boosting algorithm is introduced: a face recognition method that extends a boosting-based classifier by adding new classes while avoiding the need of retraining the classifier each time a new person joins the system. The classifier is learned using the multitask learning principle where multiple verification tasks are trained together sharing the same feature space.

The locations of some (or all) targets are unknown a priori, requiring them to be located using cooperative search.

Commonly used robust word boundary detection algorithms always assume that the background noise level is fixed. In fact, the background noise level mag vary during the procedure of recording. This is the major reason that most robust word boundary detection algorithms cannot work well in the condition of variable background noise level, In order to solve this problem, we first propose a refined time-frequency (RTF) parameter for extracting both the time and frequency features of noisy speech signals. The RTF parameter extends the (time-frequency) TF parameter proposed by Junqua et al, from single band to multiband spectrum analysis, where the frequency bands help to make the distinction between speech signal and noise clear. The RTF parameter can extract useful frequency information, Based on this RTF parameter, we further propose a new word boundary detection algorithm by using a recurrent sell-organizing neural fuzzy inference network (RSONFIN). Since RSONFIN can process the temporal relations, the proposed RTF-based RSONFIN algorithm can find the variation of the background noise level and detect correct word boundaries in the condition of variable background noise level. As compared to normal neural networks, the RSONFIN can always find itself an economic network size with high-learning speed, Due to the self-learning ability of RSONFIN, this RTF-based RSONFIN algorithm avoids the need for empirically determining ambiguous decision rules in normal word boundary detection algorithms. Experimental results show that this new algorithm achieves higher recognition rate than the TF-based algorithm which has been shown to outperform several commonly used word boundary detection algorithms by about 12% in variable background noise level condition. It also reduces the recognition error rate due to endpoint detection to about 23%, compared to an average of 47% obtained by the TF-based algorithm in the same condition.",,,,,"Lin, Chin-Teng/G-8129-2017","Lin, Chin-Teng/0000-0001-8371-8197",,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,,,,,FEB,2001,31,1,,,,,84,97,,10.1109/3477.907566,0.0,,,,,,,,18244769.0,,,,,WOS:000167276800006,0

A PDS detects pedestrians in real time on moving vehicles. A practical PDS demands not only high detection accuracy but also high detection speed. However, most of the existing classification-based approaches mainly seek for high detection accuracy, while the detection speed is not purposely optimized for practical application. At the same time, the performance, particularly the speed, is primarily tuned based on experiments without theoretical foundations, leading to a long training procedure. This paper starts with measuring and optimizing detection speed, and then a practical classification-based pedestrian detection solution with high detection speed and training speed is described. First, an extended classification/detection speed metric, named feature-per-object (fpo), is proposed to measure the detection speed independently from execution. Then, an fpo minimization model with accuracy constraints is formulated based on a tree classifier ensemble, where the minimum fpo can guarantee the highest detection speed. Finally, the minimization problem is solved efficiently by using nonlinear fitting based on radial basis function neural networks. In addition, the optimal solution is directly used to instruct classifier training; thus, the training speed could be accelerated greatly. Therefore, a rapid and accurate classification-based detection technique is proposed for the PDS. Experimental results on urban traffic videos show that the proposed method has a high detection speed with an acceptable detection rate and a false-alarm rate for onboard detection; moreover, the training procedure is also very fast.",,,,,"Xu, Yanwu/AAK-8156-2020","Xu, Yanwu/0000-0002-1779-931X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,FEB,2011,41,1,,,,,107,117,,10.1109/TSMCB.2010.2046890,0.0,,,,,,,,20457550.0,,,,,WOS:000286388300009,0

In this paper, we study dynamic coevolution between individual rational strategies (cooperative or defect) and the overlay network structure, that is, the interaction between peer's local rational behaviors and the emergence of the whole network structure. We propose an evolutionary game theory (EGT)-based overlay topology evolution scheme to drive a given overlay into the small-world structure (high global network efficiency and average clustering coefficient). Our contributions are the following threefold: From the viewpoint of peers' local interactions, we explicitly consider the peer's rational behavior and introduce a link-formation game to characterize the social dilemma of forming links in an overlay network. Furthermore, in the evolutionary link-formation phase, we adopt a simple economic process: Each peer keeps one link to a cooperative neighbor in its neighborhood, which can slightly speed up the convergence of cooperation and increase network efficiency; from the viewpoint of the whole network structure, our simulation results show that the EGT-based scheme can drive an arbitrary overlay network into a fully cooperative and efficient small-world structure. Moreover, we compare our scheme with a search-based economic model of network formation and illustrate that our scheme can achieve the experimental and analytical results in the latter model. In addition, we also graphically illustrate the final overlay network structure; finally, based on the group selection model and evolutionary set theory, we theoretically obtain the approximate threshold of cost and draw the conclusion that the small value of the average degree and the large number of the total peers in an overlay network facilitate the evolution of cooperation.",,,,,,"Nakao, Akihiro/0000-0003-0012-5287",,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,JUN,2010,40,3,,,SI,,656,667,,10.1109/TSMCB.2010.2042123,0.0,,,,,,,,20199937.0,,,,,WOS:000277774700010,0

The model of the student in our system is inferred using a higher level LA, referred to as a meta-LA, which attempts to characterize the learning model of the students ( or student simulators), while the latter use the tutorial-like system. The meta-LA, in turn, uses LAs as a learning mechanism to try to determine if the student in question is a fast, normal, or slow learner. The ultimate long-term goal of the exercise is the following: if the tutorial-like system can understand how the student perceives and processes knowledge, it will be able to customize the way by which it communicates the knowledge to the student to attain an optimal teaching strategy. The proposed meta-LA scheme has been tested for numerous environments, including the established benchmarks, and the results obtained are remarkable. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first published result that infers the learning model of an LA when it is externally treated as a black box, whose outputs are the only observable quantities. Additionally, our paper represents a new class of multiautomata systems, where the meta-LA synchronously communicates with the students, also modeled using LAs. The meta-LA's environment observes the progress of the student LA, and the response of the latter to the meta-LA actions is based on these observations.

To solve this problem, this paper develops two model selection criteria by combining or redefining the radius-margin bound used in binary SVMs. The combination is justified by linking the test error rate of a multiclass SVM with that of a set of binary SVMs. The redefinition, which is relatively heuristic, is inspired by the conceptual relationship between the radius-margin bound and the class separability measure. Hence, the two criteria are developed from the perspective of model selection rather than a generalization of the radius-margin bound for multiclass SVMS. As demonstrated by extensive experimental study, the minimization of these two criteria achieves good model selection on most data sets.

In this approach, a local hill-climbing search is used in constructing good building blocks, a weight called looseness is introduced to identify the good building blocks in individual programs, and the looseness values are used as heuristics in choosing appropriate crossover points to preserve good building blocks. This approach is examined and compared with the standard crossover operator and the headless chicken crossover (HCC) method on a sequence of object classification problems.

Developmental and neurophysiological studies suggest that imitative learning takes place once gaze-following abilities are fully established and joint attention can support the shared behavior required by imitation. Accordingly, gaze-following acquisition should be precursory to most machine learning tasks, and imitation learning can be seen as the earliest modality for acquiring meaningful gaze shifts and for understanding the structural substrate of fixations. Indeed, if some early attentional process, based on a suitable combination of gaze shifts and fixations, could be learned by the robot, then several demonstration learning tasks would be dramatically simplified. In this paper, we describe a methodology for learning gaze shifts based on imitation of gaze following with a gaze machine, which we purposefully introduced to make the robot gaze imitation conspicuous. The machine allows the robot to share and imitate gaze shifts and fixations of a caregiver through a mutual vergence. This process is then suitably generalized by learning both the scene salient features toward which the gaze is directed and the way saccadic programming is attained. Salient features are modeled by a family of Gaussian mixtures.

In the automatic target tracking system, there exists an important and difficult problem: how to detect the target maneuvers and fast response to avoid misstracking? The traditional maneuver detection algorithms, such as variable dimension filter (VDF) and input estimation (IE) etc., are computation intensive and difficult to implement in real time. To solve this problem, neural network algorithms have been issued recently. However, the normal neural networks such as backpropagation networks usually produce the extra problems of low convergence speed and/or large network size. Furthermore, the way to decide the network structure is heuristic. To overcome these defects and to make use of neural learning ability, a developed standard Kalman filter with a self-constructing neural fuzzy inference network (KF-SONFIN) algorithm for target tracking is presented in this paper.

A fuzzy measurement is defined. It possesses several unique properties, which arise from its physical nature and distinguish it from concepts such as the fuzzy number. These properties, which include the fuzzy correlation term and the fuzzy equality relation, follow directly from physical considerations. The introduction of the fuzzy correlation term provides a mathematical tool for representing any correlation relations, which may exist between different fuzzy measurements. The main function of the fuzzy correlation term is to eliminate, or filter out, measurement values that are unlikely, given other fuzzy measurements. Thus, using the fuzzy correlation term, the range of possible measurement values is limited by physical realities. The information represented by the fuzzy correlation term is shown to be of great value in providing a wider picture of reality than it is possible to obtain by simply considering individual fuzzy measurements.

Compared to other methods, our approach can detect local spatial structure in the target tensor space and fuse information from different feature spaces. Therefore, the learned appearance model is more discriminative when there are significant appearance variations of the target or when the background gets cluttered. Applying the multilinear algebra, our appearance model can efficiently be learned and updated online, without causing high-dimensional data-learning problems. Then, tracking is implemented in the Bayesian inference framework, where a likelihood model is defined to measure the similarity between a test sample and the learned appearance model, and a particle filter is used to recursively estimate the target state over time.

When the facial sketches are to be synthesized in the unique sketching style of a particular artist, the problem becomes even more complex. To resolve these problems, this paper develops an automatic facial sketch synthesis system based on a novel direct combined model (DCM) algorithm. The proposed system executes three cascaded procedures, namely, 1) synthesis of the facial shape from the input texture information (i.e., the facial image); 2) synthesis of the exaggerated facial shape from the synthesized facial shape; and 3) synthesis of a sketch from the original input image and the synthesized exaggerated shape. Previous proposals for reconstructing facial shapes and synthesizing the corresponding facial sketches are heavily reliant on the quality of the texture reconstruction results, which, in turn, are highly sensitive to occlusion and lighting effects in the input image. However, the DCM approach proposed in this paper accurately reconstructs the facial shape and then produces lifelike synthesized facial sketches without the need to recover occluded feature points or to restore the texture information lost as a result of unfavorable lighting conditions. Moreover, the DCM approach is capable of synthesizing facial sketches from input images with a wide variety of facial poses, gaze directions, and facial expressions even when such images are not included within the original training data set.",,,,,,"Tu, Ching-Ting/0000-0003-2410-726X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,AUG,2010,40,4,,,SI,,1158,1169,,10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2035154,0.0,,,,,,,,19933007.0,,,,,WOS:000282348400015,0

In each scheme, the unknown network parameters are estimated stochastically in real time, and no preliminary offline neural network training is used. In contrast to other adaptive techniques hitherto proposed in the literature on mobile robots, the dual control laws presented in this paper do not rely on the heuristic certainty equivalence property but account for the uncertainty in the estimates.

As part of an automotive safety system, the DAD presents alerts in the field of view of the driver only if necessary, which is based upon the state and pose of the driver, vehicle, and environment. This paper examines the effectiveness of DAD through a comprehensive comparative experimental evaluation of a speed compliance driver assistance system, which is implemented on a vehicular test bed. Three different types of display protocols for assisting a driver to comply with speed limits are tested on actual roadways, and these are compared with a conventional dashboard display. Given the inclination, drivers who are given an overspeed warning alert reduced the time required to slow down to the speed limit by 38% (p < 0.01) as compared with the drivers not given the alert. Additionally, certain alerts decreased distraction levels by reducing the time spent looking away from the road by 63% (p < 0.01).

To address this problem of structure identification, we propose an integrated method that can find the bad features simultaneously when finding the rules from data for Takagi-Sugeno-type fuzzy systems. It is an integrated learning mechanism that can take into account the nonlinear interactions that may be present between features and between features and fuzzy rule-based systems. Hence, it can pick up a small set of useful features and generate useful rules for the problem at hand.

The algorithm is based on the simulated annealing concept and returns a single solution that corresponds to the lexicographic ordering approach. The algorithm optimizes simultaneously the multiple objectives by assigning a different initial temperature to each one, according to its position in the hierarchy. A major advantage of the proposed method is its low computational cost. This is very critical, particularly, for online applications, where the time that is available for decision making is limited. The method is tested in a number of benchmark problems, which illustrate its ability to find near-optimal solutions even in nonconvex multiobjective optimization problems. The results are comparable with those that are produced by state-of-the-art multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, such as the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II. The algorithm is further applied to the solution of a large-scale problem that is formulated online, when a multiobjective adaptive model predictive control (MPC) configuration is adopted. This particular control scheme involves an adaptive discrete-time model of the system, which is developed using the radial-basis-function neural-network architecture. A key issue in the success of the adaptation strategy is the introduction of a persistent excitation constraint, which is transformed to a top-priority objective.

To accomplish this goal, the method eliminates features that are in the direction of the eigenvectors corresponding to the,nonzero eigenvalues; of the covariance matrix of each class. In this paper, we introduce a variation of the CV method, which will be referred to as the modified CV (MCV) method. Then, a novel approach is proposed to apply the MCV method in a nonlinearly mapped higher dimensional feature space. In this approach, all samples are mapped into a higher dimensional feature space using a kernel mapping function, and then, the MCV method is applied in the mapped space. Under certain conditions, each class gives rise to a unique CV, and the method guarantees a 100% recognition rate with respect to the training set data. Moreover, experiments with several test cases also show that the generalization performance of the proposed kernel method is comparable to the generalization performances of other linear subspace classifier methods as well as the kernel-based nonlinear subspace method.

The inverse of this problem is one of modeling how even a clear image can be perceived to be blurred in certain contexts. To our knowledge, there is no solution to this in the literature other than for an oversimplified model in which the true image is garbled with noise by the perceiver himself. In this paper, we propose a chaotic model of pattern recognition (PR) for the theory of blurring. This paper, which is an extension to a companion paper demonstrates how one can model blurring from the view point of a chaotic PR system. Unlike the companion paper in which a chaotic PR system extracts the pattern from the input, in this case, we show that even without the inclusion of additional noise, perception of an object can be blurred if the dynamics of the chaotic system are modified. We thus propose a formal model and present an analysis using the Lyapunov exponents and the Routh-Hurwitz criterion.

It holds that the revolution in computer science and artificial intelligence has reached the point that all the sciences in general can now account for the complex relations of an irreducible plurality of unique observers engaged in describing the same event. Plurimonism seeks to describe the conscious and unconscious relations of the scientific observer during the act of observation of a given event while preserving the historical uniqueness and indivisible identity of each such observer. Using the framework of plurimonism, we mathematically formulate the problem of empathy. This self-reflective mathematical model entails four components of the empathic process involving two observers. They are: 1) the self, 2) the self's-otber; 3) the other; and 4) the other's-self. It measures the degree of accuracy of the therapist-observer's empathy, as well as conscious and unconscious processes involved in the patient-observer's idealization and the therapist-observer's confidence in clinical psychotherapy. Ratings are obtained from both patient and therapist from four different points of view. The plural views of the patient's global assessment of functioning (GAF) are from: 1) the therapist's view (TGAF); 2) the patient's view (PGAF); 3) the therapist empathic view (TEGAF), which represents the therapist's estimate of PGAF; and 4) the patient's empathic estimate of the TGAF. The GAF scale is the standard dimensional 100-point-scale measure used in psychiatry for recording a patient's functioning.

Three formulae are presented that describe the degree of the therapist's empathic accuracy, the patient's over-idealization/under-idealization, and the therapist's over-confidence/under-confidence.

The indeterminate characteristics associated to used products often makes the predetermined plan unrealistic. Their disassembly process has to be decided dynamically adaptive to the products' specific status. To be able to deal with uncertainty in a dynamic decision making process, this paper presents a fuzzy reasoning Petri net (FRPN.) model to represent related decision making rules in disassembly process. Using the proposed fuzzy reasoning algorithm based on the FRPN model, the multicriterion disassembly rules can be considered in the parallel way to make the decision automatically and quickly. Instead of producing the disassembly sequences before disassembling a whole product, the proposed method makes intelligent decisions based on dynamically updated status of components in the product at each disassembly step.

Flexibility, completeness and consistency are essential for fuzzy systems to exhibit an excellent performance and to have a clear physical meaning, while compactness is crucial when the number of the input variables increases. However, the completeness and consistency conditions are often violated if a fuzzy system is generated from data collected from real world applications. In an attempt to develop FC3 fuzzy systems, a systematic design paradigm is proposed using evolution strategies. The structure of the fuzzy rules, which determines the compactness of the fuzzy systems, is evolved along with the parameters of the fuzzy systems. Special attention has been paid to the completeness and consistency of the rule base. The completeness is guaranteed by checking the completeness of the fuzzy partitioning of input variables and the completeness of the rule structure. An index of inconsistency is suggested with the help of a fuzzy similarity measure, which can prevent the algorithm from generating rules that seriously contradict with each other or with the heuristic knowledge.

This representation is then integrated in the global map so far reconstructed by filtering out insufficient or conflicting information. In the navigation phase, A*-based planner generates a local path from the current robot position to the goal. Such a path is safe inside the explored area and provides a direction for further exploration, The robot follows the path up to the boundary of the explored area, terminating its motion if unexpected obstacles are encountered.

As an unsupervised dimensionality reduction (DR) algorithm, the GPLVM has been successfully applied in many areas. However, in its current setting, GPLVM is unable to use label information, which is available for many tasks; therefore, researchers proposed many kinds of extensions to the GPLVM in order to utilize extra information, among which the supervised GPLVM (SGPLVM) has shown better performance compared with other SGPLVM extensions. However, the SGPLVM suffers in its high computational complexity. Bearing in mind the issues of the complexity and the need of incorporating additionally available information, in this paper, we propose a novel SGPLVM, called supervised latent linear GPLVM (SLLGPLVM). Our approach is motivated by both SGPLVM and supervised probabilistic principal component analysis (SPPCA). The proposed SLLGPLVM can be viewed as an appropriate compromise between the SGPLVM and the SPPCA. Furthermore, it is also appropriate to interpret the SLLGPLVM as a semiparametric regression model for supervised DR by making use of the GP to model the unknown smooth link function. Complexity analysis and experiments show that the developed SLLGPLVM outperforms the SGPLVM not only in the computational complexity but also in its accuracy.

Then, a Bayesian network is used for integrating statistical and explicit knowledge and performing hypothesis testing using evidence-driven probabilistic inference. In addition, we propose the use of a focus-of-attention (FoA) mechanism that is based on the mutual information between concepts. This mechanism selects the most prominent hypotheses to be verified/tested by the BN, hence removing the need to exhaustively test all possible combinations of the hypotheses set. We experimentally evaluate our framework using content from three domains and for the following three tasks: 1) image categorization; 2) localized region labeling; and 3) weak annotation of video shot keyframes.

Because the nonlinear functions of the systems are uncertain, traditional T-S fuzzy control methods can model and control them only with great difficulty, if at all. Instead of modeling these uncertain functions directly, we propose that a T-S fuzzy-neural model approximates a so-called virtual linearized system (VLS) of the system, which includes modeling errors and external disturbances. We also propose an online identification algorithm for the VLS and put significant emphasis on robust tracking controller design using an adaptive scheme for the uncertain systems. Moreover, the stability of the closed-loop systems is proven by using strictly positive real Lyapunov theory.

Moreover, the descriptor is rotation invariant by definition. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed descriptor in both the multiclass symbol recognition and symbol detection domains. In order to perform the symbol detection, the descriptors are learned using a cascade of classifiers. In the case of multiclass categorization, the new feature space is learned using a set of binary classifiers which are embedded in an error-correcting output code design.

To alleviate this drawback and enhance the performance of DE, in this paper, we present a family of improved DE that attempts to adaptively choose a more suitable strategy for a problem at hand. In addition, in our proposed strategy adaptation mechanism (SaM), different parameter adaptation methods of DE can be used for different strategies. In order to test the efficiency of our approach, we combine our proposed SaM with JADE, which is a recently proposed DE variant, for numerical optimization. Twenty widely used scalable benchmark problems are chosen from the literature as the test suit. Experimental results verify our expectation that the SaM is able to adaptively determine a more suitable strategy for a specific problem. Compared with other state-of-the-art DE variants, our approach performs better, or at least comparably, in terms of the quality of the final solutions and the convergence rate.

The first method by Herrera-Viedma et al. appeared in the IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS - PART B: CYBERNETICS [vol. 37, no. 1 (2007) 176-189], while the second one by Fedrizzi and Giove appeared later in the European Journal of Operational Research [vol. 183 (2007) 303-313]. The underlying concept driving both methods is the additive consistency property. We show that both methods, although different, are very similar. Both methods derive the same estimated values for the independent-missing-comparison case, while they differ in the dependent-missing-comparison case. However, it is shown that a modification of the first method coincides with the second one. Regarding the total reconstruction of an incomplete preference relation, it is true that the second method performs worse than the first one. When Herrera-Viedma et al.'s method is unsuccessful, Fedrizzi-Giove's method is as well. However, in those cases when Fedrizzi-Giove's method cannot guarantee the successful reconstruction of an incomplete preference relation, we have that Herrera-Viedma et al.'s method can. These results lead us to claim that both methods should be seen as complementary rather than competitors in their application, and as such, we propose a reconstruction policy of incomplete fuzzy preference relations using both methods. By doing this, the only unsuccessful reconstruction case is when there is a chain of missing pairwise comparisons involving each one of the feasible alternatives at least once.",,,,,"HERRERA-VIEDMA, ENRIQUE/C-2704-2008; Alonso, Sergio/GVR-8346-2022; Burgos, Sergio Alonso/C-6793-2012; Chiclana, Francisco/B-9031-2008","HERRERA-VIEDMA, ENRIQUE/0000-0002-7922-4984; Burgos, Sergio Alonso/0000-0001-6620-328X; Chiclana, Francisco/0000-0002-3952-4210",,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,DEC,2009,39,6,,,,,1628,1633,,10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2023923,0.0,,,,,,,,19556202.0,,,,,WOS:000270143800025,0

For negotiation with complete information, this paper provides mathematical proofs to show that an agent's optimal strategy can be computed using its opponent's reserve price (RP) and deadline. The impetus of this work is using the synergy of Bayesian learning (BL) and genetic algorithm (GA) to determine an agent's optimal strategy in negotiation (N) with incomplete information. BLGAN adopts: 1) BL and a deadline-estimation process for estimating an opponent's RP and deadline and 2) GA for generating a proposal at each negotiation round. Learning the RP and deadline of an opponent enables the GA in BLGAN to reduce the size of its search space (SP) by adaptively focusing its search on a specific region in the space of all possible proposals. SP is dynamically defined as a region around an agent's proposal P at each negotiation round. P is generated using the agent's optimal strategy determined using its estimations of its opponent's RP and deadline. Hence, the GA in BLGAN is more likely to generate proposals that are closer to the proposal generated by the optimal strategy. Using GA to search around a proposal generated by its current strategy, an agent in BLGAN compensates for possible errors in estimating its opponent's RP and deadline. Empirical results show that agents adopting BLGAN reached agreements successfully, and achieved: 1) higher utilities and better combined negotiation outcomes (CNOs) than agents that only adopt GA to generate their proposals, 2) higher utilities than agents that adopt 81, to learn only RP, and 3) higher utilities and better CNOs than agents that do not learn their opponents' RPs and deadlines.",,,,,,"Sim, Kwang Mong/0000-0001-8618-2957",,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,FEB,2009,39,1,,,,,198,211,,10.1109/TSMCB.2008.2004501,0.0,,,,,,,,19068440.0,,,,,WOS:000262562700018,0

Because the dynamic characteristic of the two-axis inverted-pendulum servomechanism is a nonlinear unstable nonminimum-phase underactuated system, it is difficult to design a suitable control scheme that simultaneously realizes real-time stabilization and accurate tracking control, and it is not easy to directly apply conventional computed torque strategies to this underactuated system. Therefore, the cascade DAFC scheme including inner and outer control loops is investigated for the stabilizing and tracking control of a nonlinear two-axis inverted-pendulum servomechanism. The goal of the inner control loop is to design a DAFC law so that the stick angle vector can fit the stick angle command vector derived from the stick angle reference model. In the outer loop, the reference signal vector is designed via an adaptive path planner so that the cart position vector tracks the cart position command vector.

It introduces a formal view of diagnosis in clinical settings and shows the relevance and possible uses of fuzzy cognitive maps. A constraint satisfaction method is introduced that uses the temporal uncertainty in symptom durations that may occur with particular diseases. The method results in an estimate of the stage of the disease if the temporal constraints of the disease in relation to the occurrence of the symptoms are satisfied. A lightweight fuzzy process is described and evaluated in the context of diagnosis of two confusable diseases. The process is based on the idea of an incremental simple additive model for fuzzy sets supporting and negating particular diseases. These are combined to produce an index of support for a particular disease. The process is developed to allow fuzzy symptom information on the intensity and duration of symptoms.

From the discov-red sequential patterns, we can know what items are frequently brought together and in what order they appear. However, they cannot tell us the time gaps between successive items in patterns. accordingly, Chen et al. have proposed a generalization of sequential patterns, called time-interval sequential patterns, which reveals not only the order of items, but also the time intervals between successive items [9]. An example of time-interval sequential pattern has a form like (A, I-2, B, I-1,I- C), meaning that we buy A first, then after an interval of I-2 we buy B, and finally after an interval of I-1 we buy C, where I-2 and I-1 are predetermined time ranges. Although this new type of pattern can alleviate the above concern, it causes the sharp boundary problem. That is, when a time interval is near the boundary of two predetermined time ranges, we either ignore or overemphasize it. Therefore, this paper uses the concept of fuzzy sets to extend the original research to that fuzzy time-interval sequential patterns are discovered from databases. Two efficient algorithms, the fuzzy time interval FTI)-Apriori algorithm and the FTI-PrefixSpan algorithm, are developed for mining fuzzy time-interval sequential patterns. in our simulation results, we find that the second algorithm) outperforms the first one, not only in computing time but also in scalability with respect to various parameters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,OCT,2005,35,5,,,,,959,972,,10.1109/TSMCB.2005.847741,0.0,,,,,,,,16240771.0,,,,,WOS:000232384200009,0

The state space of the neural network can be either the Cartesian workspace or the joint space of multi-joint robot manipulators, There are only local lateral connections among neurons. The real-time optimal trajectory is generated through the dynamic activity landscape of the neural network without explicitly searching over the free space nor the collision paths, without explicitly optimizing any global cost functions, without any prior knowledge of the dynamic environment, and without any learning procedures. Therefore the model algorithm is computationally efficient, The stability of the neural network system is guaranteed by the existence of a Lyapunov function candidate. In addition, this model is not very sensitive to the model parameters, Several model variations are presented and the differences are discussed. As examples, the proposed models are applied to generate collision-free trajectories for a mobile robot to solve a maze-type of problem, to avoid concave U-shaped obstacles, to track a moving target and at the same to avoid varying obstacles, and to generate a trajectory for a two-link planar robot with two targets.

In this paper, we introduce several orthogonal transformation-based methods that provide new or alternative tools for rule selection.

Moreover, in contrast to traditional fuzzy systems where the input-output spaces are partitioned as grid type causing the combinatorial growing of fuzzy rules as the input-output dimensions increase, irregular partitions are done in the ANFF according to the distribution of training data so fewer fuzzy rules will be generated, To demonstrate the performance of the ANFF, two applications, the nonlinear channel equalization and the adaptive noise cancellation, are simulated, Efficiency and advantages of the ANFF are verified by these simulations and comparisons.",,,,,"Lin, Chin-Teng/G-8129-2017; Juang, Chia-Feng/A-8795-2008","Lin, Chin-Teng/0000-0001-8371-8197; Juang, Chia-Feng/0000-0002-3713-4315",,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,AUG,1997,27,4,,,,,635,656,,10.1109/3477.604107,0.0,,,,,,,,18255903.0,,,,,WOS:A1997XL45000006,0

An effect of the global matching criterion is that cross correlations at all pixels contribute to the criterion; since cross correlation can change significantly even with subpixel changes, to achieve subpixel accuracy, it is no longer sufficient to first find the path that maximizes the criterion at integer pixel locations and then refine to subpixel accuracy.

However, it is now well established that the interpretation of the results from these measures are confounded by the recording reference signal and that this problem is not mitigated by the use of other EEG montages, such as bipolar and average reference. In this paper, we analyze the impact of reference signal amplitude and power on EEG signal correlation, phase synchrony, and MSC. We show that, first, when two nonreferential signals have negative correlation, the phase synchrony and the absolute value of the correlation of the two referential signals may have two regions of behavior characterized by a monotonic decrease to zero and then a monotonic increase to one as the amplitude of the reference signal varies in [0,+infinity). It is notable that even a small change of the amplitude may lead to significant impact on these two measures. Second, when two nonreferential signals have positive correlation, the correlation and phase-synchrony values of the two referential signals can monotonically increase to one (or monotonically decrease to some positive value and then monotonically increase to one) as the amplitude of the reference signal varies in [0,+infinity). Third, when two nonreferential signals have negative cross-power, the MSC of the two referential signals can monotonically decrease to zero and then monotonically increase to one as reference signal power varies in [0,+infinity). Fourth, when two nonreferential signals have positive cross-power, the MSC of the two referential signals can monotonically increase to one as the reference signal power varies in [0,+infinity). In general, the reference signal with small amplitude or power relative to the signals of interest may decrease or increase the values of correlation, phase synchrony, and MSC. However, the reference signal with high relative amplitude or power will always increase each of the three measures. In our previous paper, we developed a method to identify and extract the reference signal contribution to intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings. In this paper, we apply this approach to referential iEEG recorded from human subjects and directly investigate the contribution of recording reference on correlation, phase synchrony, and MSC.

Compared with previously proposed texture features, e. g., high gradient component features, image ratio features are more robust to albedo and lighting variations. In addition, to further improve facial expression recognition accuracy based on image ratio features, we combine image ratio features with facial animation parameters (FAPs), which describe the geometric motions of facial feature points. The performance evaluation is based on the Carnegie Mellon University Cohn-Kanade database, our own database, and the Japanese Female Facial Expression database.

Most research has been focused on the development of new iris processing and recognition algorithms for frontal view iris images. However, a few challenging directions in iris research have been identified, including processing of a nonideal iris and iris at a distance. In this paper, we describe two nonideal iris recognition systems and analyze their performance. The word nonideal is used in the sense of compensating for off-angle occluded iris images. The system is designed to process nonideal iris images in two steps: 1) compensation for off-angle gaze direction and 2) processing and encoding of the rotated iris image. Two approaches are presented to account for angular variations in the iris images. In the first approach, we use Daugman's integrodifferential operator as an objective function to estimate the gaze direction. After the angle is estimated, the off-angle iris image undergoes geometric transformations involving the estimated angle and is further processed as if it were a frontal view image. The encoding technique developed for a frontal image is based on the application of the global independent component analysis. The second approach uses an angular deformation calibration model. The angular deformations are modeled, and calibration parameters are calculated. The proposed method consists of a closed-form solution, followed by an iterative optimization procedure. The images are projected on the plane closest to the base calibrated plane. Biorthogonal wavelets are used for encoding to perform iris recognition. We use a special dataset of the off-angle iris images to quantify the performance of the designed systems.

Traditionally, intrusion detection relies on extensive knowledge of security experts, in particular, on their familiarity with the computer system to be protected. To reduce this dependence, various data-mining and machine learning techniques have been deployed for intrusion detection. An IDS is usually working in a dynamically changing environment, which forces continuous tuning of the intrusion detection model, in order to maintain sufficient performance. The manual tuning process required by current systems depends on the system operators in working out the tuning solution and in integrating it into the detection model. In this paper, an automatically tuning IDS (ATIDS) is presented. The proposed system will automatically tune the detection model on-the-fly according to the feedback provided by the system operator when false predictions are encountered. The system is evaluated using the KDDCup'99 intrusion detection dataset. Experimental results show that the system achieves up to 35% improvement in terms of misclassification cost when compared with a system lacking the tuning feature. If only 10% false predictions are used to tune the model, the system still achieves about 30% improvement. Moreover, when tuning is not delayed too long, the system can achieve about 20% improvement, with only 1.3% of the false predictions used to tune the model.

In this paper, we also address the design of fuzzy systems from data. A new evolutionary approach is proposed for deriving a compact fuzzy classification system directly from data without any a priori knowledge or assumptions on the distribution of the data. At the beginning of the algorithm, the fuzzy classifier is empty with no rules in the rule base and no membership functions assigned to fuzzy variables. Then, rules and membership functions are automatically created and optimized in an evolutionary process. To accomplish this, parameters of the variable input spread inference training (VISIT) algorithm are used to code fuzzy systems on the training data set. Therefore, we can derive each individual fuzzy system via the VISIT algorithm, and then search the best one via genetic operations. To evaluate the fuzzy classifier, a fuzzy expert system acts as the fitness function. This fuzzy expert system can effectively evaluate the accuracy and compactness at the same time.

The authors' motivation is as follows. Complex industrial processes can be often decomposed into many parallelly working subprocesses, which can, in turn, be modeled using Petri nets. If all the process variables (or events) are assumed to be two-valued signals, then it is possible to obtain a hardware or software control device, which works according to the algorithm described by conventional Petri net. However, the values of real signals are contained in some bounded interval and can be interpreted as events which are not only true or false, but rather true in some degree from the interval [0,1]. Such a natural interpretation from multivalued logic (fuzzy logic) point of view, concerns sensor outputs, control signals, time expiration, etc. It leads to the idea of FPN as a controller, which one can rather simply obtain, and which would be able to process both analog, and binary signals. In the paper both graphical, and algebraic representations of the proposed FPN are given. The conditions under which transitions can be fired are described. The algebraic description of the net and a theorem which enables computation of new marking in the net, based on current marking, are formulated. Hardware implementation of the FPN, which uses fuzzy JK flip-flops and fuzzy gates, are proposed.

Our framework is based on two guiding principles of HCl: 1) provide the human with as much visual assistance as possible to help the human make a correct input; and 2) verify each input provided by the human for its consistency with the inputs previously provided. For example, when stereo correspondence information is elicited from a human, his/her job is facilitated by superimposing epipolar lines on the images. Although that reduces the possibility of error in the human marked correspondences, such errors are not entirely eliminated because there can be multiple candidate points close together for complex objects. For another example, when pose-to-pose correspondence is sought from a human, his/her job is made easier by allowing the human to rotate the partial model constructed in the previous pose in relation to the partial model for the current pose. While this facility reduces the incidence of human-supplied pose-to-pose correspondence errors, such errors cannot be eliminated entirely because of confusion created when multiple candidate features exist close together. Each input provided by the human is therefore checked against the previous inputs by invoking situation-specific constraints. Different types of constraints (and different human-computer interaction protocols) are needed for the extraction of polygonal features and for the extraction of curved features. We will show results on both polygonal objects and object containing curved features.",,,,,"Motai, Yuichi/G-9740-2017","Motai, Yuichi/0000-0002-1957-1896",,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,FEB,2004,34,1,,,,,566,578,,10.1109/TSMCB.2003.817085,0.0,,,,,,,,15369093.0,,,,,WOS:000188464600049,0

Note that the construction of the classifier essentially depends on the estimate of a fuzzy relation between the input (fuzzy set) and output (fuzzy set) of the classifier. Once the classifier is constructed, the nonfuzzy features of a pattern can be classified.

In a typical optimization process the algorithm has to work its way toward the maximum (minimum) using local information. However, the crucial issue in these strategies is that of determining the parameter to be used in the optimization itself, If the parameter is too small the convergence is sluggish. On the other hand, if the parameter is too large, the system could erroneously converge or even oscillate. The strategy presented here can be utilized to determine the best parameter to be used in the optimization.",,,,,"Oommen, B. John/P-6323-2017","Oommen, B.

Hence, both learning sample-specific localmodels for each training datum and extending the learned models to unseen test data should be equally addressed in designing LMKL algorithm. In this paper, for an integrative solution, we propose a probability confidence kernel (PCK), which measures per-sample similarity with respect to probabilistic-prediction-based class attribute: The class attribute similarity complements the spatial-similarity-based base kernels for more reasonable locality characterization, and the predefined form of involved class probability density function facilitates the extension to the whole input space and ensures its statistical meaning.

To detect changes between behaviors, we use statistical pattern matching calculations performed on a sliding window of data samples. If the window size is very small, the system will suffer from excessive false-positive rates. If the window is very large, change-point detection is delayed.

This paper presents a method to reduce the expense of computing the eigenspace decomposition of a set of images when variations in both illumination and pose are present. In particular, it is shown that the set of images of an object under a wide range of illumination conditions and a fixed pose can be significantly reduced by projecting these data onto a few low-frequency spherical harmonics, producing a set of harmonic images. It is then shown that the dimensionality of the set of harmonic images at different poses can be further reduced by utilizing the fast Fourier transform.

Unlike the conventional 3-D model similarity retrieval approach, the query model and the models obtained by 3-D model hybrid associative retrieval have the following properties: They belong to different model classes and have different shape characteristics in general but are semantically related and preassembled in a certain associative group. For instance, given a furniture associative group {desk, chair, bed}, we may probably like to use a desk as a query model to search for a list of matching models, which belong to the chair or bed class. We consider the following possibilities: 1) there can be more than two classes in an association group and 2) different association groups might have different numbers of classes. The hybrid associative retrieval is performed in two stages: 1) to establish the relationship between different 3-D model categories with semantic associations, we propose three approaches based on neural network learning and 2) to address the aforementioned two conditions, we use a cyclic-shift scheme to partition different associative groups into two-class pairwise associative groups and then adopt two different strategies to combine the final retrieval results. Experiments by using different data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework on the new hybrid associative retrieval task.",,,,,,"IP, Ho Shing Horace/0000-0002-1509-9002; WONG, Hau-San/0000-0002-1530-7529",,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,DEC,2010,40,6,,,,,1582,1595,,10.1109/TSMCB.2010.2043671,0.0,,,,,,,,20350844.0,,,,,WOS:000284364400014,0

Random projection (RP) is an alternative dimensionality reduction method that is data independent and bypasses these problems.

To obtain higher recognition accuracy, this study looks at the robustness of RP dimensionality reduction for several recently proposed classifiers-sparse classifier (SC), group SC (along with their fast versions), and the nearest subspace classifier.

This paradigm has been generalized in a myriad of ways, including the scenario when there are multiple teachers or a hierarchy of mechanisms that collectively achieve the learning. In this paper, we consider a departure from this paradigm by allowing the Student to be a member of a classroom of Students, where, for the most part, we permit each member of the classroom not only to learn from the teacher(s) but also to extract information from any of his fellow Students. This paper deals with issues concerning the modeling, decision-making process, and testing of such a scenario within the LA context. The main result that we show is that a weak learner can actually benefit from this capability of utilizing the information that he gets from a superior colleague-if this information transfer is done appropriately. As far as we know, the whole concept of Students learning from both a teacher and from a classroom of Students is novel and unreported in the literature. The proposed Student-classroom interaction has been tested for numerous strategies and for different environments, including the established benchmarks, and the results show that Students can improve their learning by interacting with each other. For example, for some interaction strategies, a weak Student can improve his learning by up to 73% when interacting with a classroom of Students, which includes Students of various capabilities.

Whereas methods known as adaptive control and learning control focus on modifying the design of a controller as changes in context occur, experience-based (EB) control entails selecting a previously designed controller that is appropriate to the current situation. Developing the EB approach entails a shift of the technologist's focus up a level away from designing individual (optimal) controllers to that of developing online algorithms that efficiently and effectively select designs from a repository of existing controller solutions.

To decide when to make a proposal, two strategies based on fixed waiting time and a fixed waiting ratio are proposed. Results from a series of experiments suggest that, guided by the two strategies for deciding when to make a proposal, the flexible negotiation mechanism achieved more favorable trading outcomes as compared with the general one-to-many negotiation mechanism.

The enormous amount of information available in the information sources in a distributed information-providing environment has created a need to provide users with tools to effectively and efficiently navigate and retrieve information. Queries in such an environment often access information from multiple information sources. This may be attributed to navigational characteristics. Clusters provide a structure for organizing the large number of information sources for efficient browsing, searching, and retrieval. This paper presents a stochastically-based clustering mechanism, called the Markov model mediator (MMM), to group the information sources into a set of useful clusters. Each information source cluster groups those information sources that show similarities in their data access behavior. Information sources within the same cluster are expected to be able to provide most of the required information among themselves for user queries that are closely related with respect to a particular application. This can significantly improve system response time, query performance, and result in an overall improvement in decision support.

But benchmarking of new software strategies is a very complex problem, because it is difficult (if not impossible) to test, validate and verify the results of the various schemes in completely different settings. This is even more true in the case of database systems because the benchmarking also depends on the types of queries presented to the databases used in the benchmarking experiments. Query optimization strategies in relational database systems rely on approximately estimating the query result sizes to minimize the response tithe for user-queries. Among the many query result size estimation techniques, the histogram-based techniques are by far the most commonly used ones in modern-day database systems. These techniques estimate the query result sizes by approximating the underlying data distributions, and, thus, are prone to estimation errors. In two recent works [16], [17] we proposed (and thoroughly analyzed) two new forms of histogram-like techniques called the rectangular and trapezoidal attribute cardinality maps (ACM), respectively, that give much smaller estimation errors than the traditional equi-width and equi-depth histograms currently being used by many commercial database systems. This paper reports how the benchmarking of the Rectangular-ACM (R-ACM) and the Trapezoidal-ACM (T-ACM) for query optimization can be achieved. By conducting an extensive set of experiments using the acclaimed TPC-D benchmark queries and database [25], we demonstrate that these new ACM schemes are much more accurate than the traditional histograms for query result size estimation. Apart from demonstrating the power of the ACMs, this paper also shows how the TPC-D benchmarking can be achieved using a large synthetic database with many different patterns of synthetic queries, which are representative of a real-world business environment.",,,,,"Oommen, B.

Fuzzy-neural networks are traditionally trained by using gradient-based methods, which may fall into local minimum during the learning process. To overcome the problems encountered by the conventional learning methods, genetic algorithms are adopted because of their capabilities of directed random search for global optimization. It is well known, however, that the searching speed of the conventional genetic algorithms is not desirable. Such conventional genetic algorithms are inherently incapable of dealing with a vast number (over 100) of adjustable parameters in the fuzzy-neural networks. In this paper, the RGA is proposed by using a sequential-search-based crossover point (SSCP) method in which a better crossover point is determined and only the gene at the specified crossover point is crossed, serving as a single gene crossover operation. Chromosomes consisting of both, the control points of BMFs and the weightings of the fuzzy-neural network are coded as an adjustable vector with real number components that are searched by the RGA. Simulation results have shown that faster convergence of the evolution process searching for an optimal fuzzy-neural network can be achieved.

This paper addresses the scene-analysis problem by integrating a primitive segmentation stage with a model of associative memory.

Primitive segmentation is performed by locally excitatory globally inhibitory oscillator network (LEGION), which segments the input scene into multiple parts that correspond to groups of synchronous oscillations. Each segment triggers memory recall and multiple recalled patterns then interact with one another in the STM layer. The STM layer projects to the LEGION network, giving rise to memory-based grouping and segmentation. The system achieves scene analysis entirely in phase space, which provides a unifying mechanism for both bottom-up analysis and top-down analysis. The model is evaluated with a systematic set of three-dimensional (3-D) line drawing objects, which are arranged in an arbitrary fashion to compose input scenes that allow object occlusion.

A fundamental and most widely applied method for analyzing Petri nets is reachability analysis. The existing technique for reachability analysis of TPNs, however, is not suitable for timing property verification because one cannot derive end-to-end delay in task execution, an important issue for time-critical systems, from the reachability tree constructed using the technique. In this paper, we present a new reachability based analysis technique for TPNs for timing property analysis and verification that effectively addresses the problem. Our technique is based on a concept called clock-stamped state class (CS-class), With the reachability tree generated based on CS-classes, we can directly compute the end-to-end time delay in task execution. Moreover, a CS-class can be uniquely mapped to a traditional state class based on which the conventional reachability tree is constructed, Therefore, our CS-class-based analysis technique is more general than the existing technique, We show how to apply this technique to timing property verification of the TPN model of a command and control (C2) system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,OCT,2000,30,5,,,,,725,736,,10.1109/3477.875448,0.0,,,,,,,,18252405.0,,,,,WOS:000089820700009,0

For example, to well characterize a natural scene image, it is essential to find a set of visual features to represent its color, texture, and shape information and encode each feature into a vector. Therefore, we have a set of vectors in different spaces to represent the image. Conventional spectral-embedding algorithms cannot deal with such datum directly, so we have to concatenate these vectors together as a new vector. This concatenation is not physically meaningful because each feature has a specific statistical property. Therefore, we develop a new spectral-embedding algorithm, namely, multiview spectral embedding (MSE), which can encode different features in different ways, to achieve a physically meaningful embedding. In particular, MSE finds a low-dimensional embedding wherein the distribution of each view is sufficiently smooth, and MSE explores the complementary property of different views.

These properties make the proposed method particularly suitable for identification by gait, where the advantages of completely unobtrusiveness, remoteness, and covertness of the biometric system preclude the availability of camera information and specific walking directions. The approach has been assessed for feature extraction and recognition capabilities on the SOTON gait database and then evaluated on a multiview database to establish recognition capability with respect to view invariance. Moreover, tests on the multiview CASIA-B database, composed of more than 2270 video sequences with 65 different subjects walking freely along different walking directions, have been performed.

Therefore, a linear-matrix-inequality (LMI) formulation of the problem is used to address the optimization problem and to simultaneously resolve the consensus achievement constraint. Moreover, by invoking an LMI formulation, a semidecentralized controller structure that is based on the neighboring sets, i.e., the network underlying graph, can be imposed as an additional constraint. Consequently, the only information that each controller requires is the one that it receives from agents in its neighboring set.

This is also evident in the literature that shows that only models of small portions of the genome could be used in control applications. In this paper, we empower our framework for controlling GRNs by eliminating the need for expert knowledge to specify some crucial threshold that is necessary for producing effective results. Our framework is characterized by applying the factored Markov decision problem ( FMDP) method to the control problem of GRNs. The FMDP is a suitable framework for large state spaces as it represents the probability distribution of state transitions using compact models so that more space and time efficient algorithms could be devised for solving control problems.

As examples, we consider the so-called (N + N) EAs and we show that, on two well-known unimodal problems, LEADINGONES and ONEMAX, the EAs with the bitwise mutation and two commonly used selection schemes both need O(n ln n + n(2)/N) and O(n ln ln n + n ln n/N) generations to find the global optimum, respectively. Except for the new results above, our approach can also be applied directly for obtaining results for some population-based EAs on some other unimodal problems.

After authentication, two agents should be entitled to believe that they are communicating with each other and not with intruders. For specifying and reasoning about the security properties of authentication protocols, many researchers have proposed the use of belief logics. Since authentication protocols are designed to operate in dynamic environments, it is important to model the evolution of authentication systems through time in a systematic way. We advocate the systematic combinations of logics of beliefs and time for modeling and reasoning about evolving agent beliefs in MASS. In particular, we use a temporal belief logic called TML+ for establishing trust theories for authentication systems and also propose a labeled tableau system for this logic. To illustrate the capabilities of TML+, we present trust theories for several well-known authentication protocols, namely, the Lowe modified wide-mouthed frog protocol, the amended Needham-Schroeder symmetric key protocol, and Kerberos.

The development of control algorithms is based on sliding mode control (SMC) technique. First, a dynamic model is derived based on the practical omnidirectional mobile manipulator system. Then, a SMC scheme, based on the fixed large upper boundedness of the system dynamics (FLUBSMC), is designed to ensure trajectory tracking of the closed-loop system. However, the FLUBSNIC scheme has inherent deficiency, which needs computing the upper boundedness of the system dynamics, and may cause high noise amplification and high control cost, particularly for the complex dynamics of the omnidirectional mobile manipulator system. Therefore, a robust neural network (NN)-based sliding mode controller (NNSMC), which uses an NN to identify the unstructured system dynamics directly, is further proposed to overcome the disadvantages of FLUBSMC and reduce the online computing burden of conventional NN adaptive controllers. Using learning ability of NN, NNSMC can coordinately control the omnidirectional mobile platform and the mounted manipulator with different dynamics effectively. The stability of the closed-loop system, the convergence of the NN weight-updating process, and the boundedness of the NN weight estimation errors are all strictly guaranteed. Then, in order to accelerate the NN learning efficiency, a partitioned NN structure is applied. Finally, simulation examples are given to demonstrate the proposed NNSMC approach can guarantee the whole system's convergence to the desired manifold with prescribed performance.",,,,,"Yi, Jianqiang/AAD-4898-2020",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,JUN,2009,39,3,,,,,788,799,,10.1109/TSMCB.2008.2009464,0.0,,,,,,,,19336336.0,,,,,WOS:000266069600016,0

Based on a simplified MAOS version, in which each agent manipulates on extremely limited declarative knowledge, some simple and efficient components for solving TSP, including two improving heuristics based on a generalized edge assembly recombination, are implemented. Compared with metaheuristics in adaptive memory programming, MAOS is particularly suitable for supporting cooperative search.

The contributions of MAOS components are investigated. It indicates that certain clues can be positive for making suitable selections before time-consuming computation. More importantly, it shows that the cooperative search of agents can achieve an overall good performance with a macro rule in the switch mode, which deploys certain alternate search rules with the offline performance in negative correlations.

This paper addresses key modeling and computational problems at the interface between model-based diagnosis techniques and signature analysis to enable the efficient detection and isolation of incipient and abrupt faults in hybrid systems. A hybrid automata model that parameterizes abrupt and incipient faults is introduced. Based on this model, an approach for diagnoser design is presented.

In addition, a suitable selection of this weighted function (connected with frequency) could reduce the effect of disturbance on the control input. However, an output disturbance caused by the interactions among subsystems, modeling error, and external load deteriorated system performance or even brought about instability. In this situation, the H-infinity-norm of weighted sensitivity between output disturbance and output error was minimized to attenuate the effect of output disturbance. Moreover, an appropriate selection of this weighted function (related to frequency) could reject the corresponding output disturbance. No solution of Diophantine equation was required; the computational advantage was especially dominated for low-order system. For further improving system performance, a switching control for every subsystem was designed. The proposed control (mixed H-2/H-infinity DDVSC) was a three-step design method.

However, such a scheme is not very effective on local learners such as nearest-neighbor classifiers because a slight change in training data can hardly result in local learners with big differences. In this paper, a new ensemble algorithm named Filtered Attribute Subspace based Bagging with Injected Randomness (FASBIR) is proposed for building ensembles of local learners, which utilizes multimodal perturbation to help generate accurate but diverse component learners. In detail, FASBIR employs the perturbation on the training data with bootstrap sampling, the perturbation on the input attributes with attribute filtering and attribute subspace selection, and the perturbation on the learning parameters with randomly configured distance metrics.

The development of minimal set of test inputs takes into consideration various criteria, both user-defined, and domain-specific. These criteria are used to reduce the potentially very large set of test inputs to one that is practical, keeping in mind the nature and purpose of the developed system. The Turing Test-like evaluation methodology makes use of only one panel of experts to both evaluate each set of test cases and compare the results with those of the expert system, as well as with those of the other experts.

The scheme addresses all major issues (number of prototypes, generation of prototypes, and utilization of the prototypes) involved in the design of a prototype-based classifier. First we use Kohonen's self-organizing feature map (SOFM) algorithm to produce a minimum number (equal to the number of classes) of initial prototypes. Then we use a dynamic prototype generation and tuning algorithm (DYNAGEN) involving merging, splitting, deleting, and retraining of the prototypes to generate an adequate number of useful prototypes. These prototypes are used to design a 1 nearest multiple prototype (1-NMP) classifier. Though the classifier performs quite well, it cannot reasonably deal with large variation of variance among the data from different classes. To overcome this deficiency we design a 1 most similar prototype (1-MSP) classifier. We use the prototypes generated by the SOFM-based DYNAGEN algorithm and associate with each of them a zone of influence. A norm (Euclidean)-induced similarity measure is used for this. The prototypes and their zones of influence are fine-tuned by minimizing an error function. Both classifiers are trained and tested using several data sets, and a consistent improvement in performance of the latter over the former has been observed. We also compared our classifiers with some benchmark results available in the literature.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,DEC,2001,31,6,,,,,881,890,,10.1109/3477.969492,0.0,,,,,,,,18244854.0,,,,,WOS:000172566600004,0

This differentiation is based on density variations and the fact that most of the log is clear wood, Third, by generalizing 8-neighbor connectivity to 3-dimensions, sequences of consecutive, segmented 2-D slices are then analyzed to find connected 3-D regions, Because of the natural variability of wood and the variety of ways defects manifest themselves in logs, there is considerable imprecision and ambiguity in assigning labels to these 3-D regions, One consequence of this variability is that exact 3-D geometric models seemingly cannot be used In the recognition process, Therefore, a set of basic features are defined to capture basic 3-D characteristics of wood defects, For 3-D object (defect) recognition, a set of hypothesis tests are employed that use this set of features, To further help cope with the above mentioned variability, the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidential reasoning is used to classify defect objects.

This paper first adopts an in-depth investigation to the USP in PCR, which answers three questions: 1) Why is USP produced? 2) What is the condition for USP, and 3) How is the influence of USP on regression. With the help of the above analysis, the principal components selection problem of PCR is presented. Subsequently, to address the problem of PCR, a multivariate multilinear regression (MMR) model is proposed which gives a substitutive solution to MLR, under the condition of multilinear objects. The basic idea of MMR is to transfer the multilinear structure of objects into the regression coefficients as a constraint. As a result, the regression problem is reduced to find two low-dimensional coefficients so that the principal components selection problem is avoided. Moreover, the sample size needed for solving MMR is greatly reduced so that USP is alleviated. As there is no closed-form solution for MMR, an alternative projection procedure is designed to obtain the regression matrices. For the sake of completeness, the analysis of computational cost and the proof of convergence are studied subsequently. Furthermore, MMR is applied to model the fitting procedure in the active appearance model (AAM). Experiments are conducted on both the carefully designed synthesizing data set and AAM fitting databases verified the theoretical analysis.",,,,,"Li, Xuelong/ABF-3381-2020; Li, Xuelong/Z-3785-2019; li, xiang/GWM-6319-2022","Li, Xuelong/0000-0002-0019-4197",,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,DEC,2012,42,6,,,,,1560,1573,,10.1109/TSMCB.2012.2195171,0.0,,,,,,,,22677310.0,,,,,WOS:000311353700005,0

Shape appearance and temporal dynamics of both genders are integrated into a sequential model called mixed conditional random field (CRF) (MCRF), which provides an open framework applicable to various spatiotemporal features. In this paper, for the spatial part, pyramids of fitting coefficients are used to generate the gait shape descriptors; for the temporal part, neighborhood-preserving embeddings are clustered to allocate the stance indexes over gait cycles. During these processes, we employ evaluation functions like the partition index and Xie and Beni's index to improve the feature sparseness. By fusion of shape descriptors and stance indexes, the MCRF is constructed in coordination with intra-and intergender temporary Markov properties. Analogous to the maximum likelihood decision used in hidden Markov models (HMMs), several classification strategies on the MCRF are discussed.

It is known that humans can adapt the dynamics of their limbs by adjusting their neuromuscular settings, and it is likely that these adaptations have a large influence on BDFT. The goal of this paper is to present a method that can provide evidence for this hypothesis. Limb dynamics can be described by admittance, which is the causal dynamic relation between a force input and a position output. This paper presents a method to simultaneously measure BDFT and admittance in a motion-based simulator. The method was validated in an experiment. Admittance was measured by applying a force disturbance signal to the control device; BDFT was measured by applying a motion disturbance signal to the motion simulator. To allow distinguishing between the operator's responses to each disturbance signal, the perturbation signals were separated in the frequency domain. To show the impact of neuromuscular adaptation, subjects were asked to perform three different control tasks, each requiring a different setting of the neuromuscular system (NMS). Results show a dependence of BDFT on neuromuscular admittance: A change in neuromuscular admittance results in a change in BDFT dynamics. This dependence is highly relevant when studying BDFT. The data obtained with the proposed measuring method provide insight in how exactly the settings of the NMS influence the level of BDFT.

The problem involved with the estimation of the local model parameters of neurofuzzy networks is the presence of noise in measured data. When some or all input channels are subject to noise, the GTLS algorithm yields consistent parameter estimates. In addition to the estimation of the parameters, the main challenge in the design of these local model networks is the determination of the region of validity for the local models. The method presented in this paper is based on an expectation-maximization algorithm that uses a residual from the GTLS parameter estimation for proper partitioning. The performance of the resulting nonlinear model with local parameters estimated by weighted GTLS is a product both of the parameter estimation itself and the associated residual used for the partitioning process. The applicability and benefits of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated by means of illustrative examples and an automotive application.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,OCT,2009,39,5,,,,,1121,1133,,10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2013132,0.0,,,,,,,,19336320.0,,,,,WOS:000267865400004,0

Since CARP is NP-hard and exact methods are only applicable for small instances, heuristics and metaheuristic methods are widely adopted when solving CARP. This paper demonstrates one major disadvantage encountered by traditional search algorithms and proposes a novel operator named global repair operator (GRO) to address it. We further embed GRO in a recently proposed tabu search algorithm (TSA) and apply the resultant repair-based tabu search (RTS) algorithm to five well-known benchmark test sets. Empirical results suggest that RTS not only outperforms TSA in terms of quality of solutions but also converges to the solutions faster. Moreover, RTS is also competitive with a number of state-of-the-art approaches for CARP. The efficacy of GRO is thereby justified.

This exploration has led to the identification of the main mechanisms, including the important role played in the recognition process by the modalities, dynamics. Constrained by the human physiology, the temporal evolution of a modality appears to be well approximated by a sequence of temporal segments called onset, apex, and offset. Stemming from these findings, computer scientists, over the past 15 years, have proposed various methodologies to automate the recognition process. We note, however, two main limitations to date. The first is that much of the past research has focused on affect recognition from single modalities. The second is that even the few multimodal systems have not paid sufficient attention to the modalities' dynamics: The automatic determination of their temporal segments, their synchronization to the purpose of modality fusion, and their role in affect recognition are yet to be adequately explored. To address this issue, this paper focuses on affective face and body display, proposes a method to automatically detect their temporal segments or phases, explores whether the detection of the temporal phases can effectively support recognition of affective states, and recognizes affective states based on phase synchronization/alignment. The experimental results obtained show the following: 1) affective face and body displays are simultaneous but not strictly synchronous; 2) explicit detection of the temporal phases can improve the accuracy of affect recognition; 3) recognition from fused face and body modalities performs better than that from the face or the body modality alone; and 4) synchronized feature-level fusion achieves better performance than decision-level fusion.",,,,,"Piccardi, Massimo/AAY-1323-2020","Piccardi, Massimo/0000-0001-9250-6604",,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,FEB,2009,39,1,,,,,64,84,,10.1109/TSMCB.2008.927269,0.0,,,,,,,,19068431.0,,,,,WOS:000262562700008,0

In traditional appearance-based pose estimation methods, features are typically extracted holistically by subspace analysis such as principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), etc., which are not designed to directly model the pose variations. In this paper, we argue and reveal that the asymmetry in the intensities of each row of the face image is closely relevant to the yaw rotation of the head and, at the same time, evidently insensitive to the identity of the input face. Specifically, to extract the asymmetry information, 1-D Gabor filters and Fourier transform are exploited. LDA is further applied to the asymmetry features to enhance the discrimination ability. By using the simple nearest centroid classifier, experimental results on two multipose databases show that the proposed features outperform other features.

The information about the global goal and the long-range sensory data are used by the first layer of the planner to produce an intermediate goal, referred to as the way-point, that gives a favorable direction in terms of seeking the goal within the detected area. The second layer of the planner takes this way-point as a subgoal and, using short-range sensory data, guides the robot to reach the subgoal while avoiding collisions.

However, most research work explores incremental learning with statistical algorithms or neural networks, rather than evolutionary algorithms. The work in this paper employs genetic algorithms (GAs) as basic learning algorithms for incremental learning within one or more classifier agents in a multiagent environment. Four new approaches with different initialization schemes are proposed. They keep the old solutions and use an integration operation to integrate them with new elements to accommodate new attributes, while biased mutation and crossover operations are adopted to further evolve a reinforced solution. The simulation results on benchmark classification data sets show that the proposed, approaches can deal with the arrival of new input attributes and integrate them with the original input space.

In many cases, some attributes are not relevant to concepts in the data at all. In this paper, we propose a novel separability-correlation measure (SCM) to rank the importance of attributes. According to the attribute ranking results, different attribute subsets are used as inputs to a classifier, such as an RBF neural network. Those attributes that increase the validation error are deemed irrelevant and are deleted. The complexity of the classifier can thus be reduced and its classification performance improved. Computer simulations show that our method for attribute importance ranking leads to smaller attribute subsets with higher accuracies compared with the existing SUD and Relief-F methods.

Trajectory modification and corrections are particularly important in dealing with dynamic tasks.

However, a trajectory leading from the first target to the final one is added vectorially to the initial one to yield the combined modified motion. A method for choosing the temporal parameters of this trajectory modification scheme is suggested so as to minimize the total travelling time under existing kinematic constraints (including both joint and hand space constraints), Then, a variant of this strategy is presented, dealing with trajectory modification in the case that the targets (both the initial and final ones) specify the desired end-point orientation rather than position.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,,,,,FEB,1999,29,1,,,,,83,95,,10.1109/3477.740168,0.0,,,,,,,,18252282.0,,,,,WOS:000078094200008,0

As a computationally efficient example of such networks, we describe a specific MANN, that is, a multi-associative, dynamically generated variant of the counterpropagation network (MCPN), As an application of MANN's, we design a general system that can learn and retrieve complex spatio-temporal sequences with any MANN, This system consists of comparator units, a parallel array of MANN's, and delayed feedback lines from the output of the system to the neural network layer. During learning, pairs of sequences of spatial patterns are presented to the system and the system learns to associate patterns at successive times in sequence. During retrieving, a cue sequence, which may be obscured by spatial noise and temporal gaps, causes the system to output the stored spatio-temporal sequence. We prove analytically that this system is capable of learning and generating any spatio-temporal sequences within the maximum complexity determined by the number of embedded MANN's, with the maximum,length and number of sequences determined by the memory capacity of the embedded MANN's, To demonstrate the applicability of this general system, we present an implementation using the MCPN.

A learning control system is designed so that its ''learning controller'' has the ability to improve the performance of the closed-loop system by generating command inputs to the plant and utilizing feedback information from the plant. Learning controllers are often designed to mimic the manner in which a human in the control loop would learn how to control a system while it operates. Some characteristics of this human learning process may include: (i) a natural tendency for the human to focus their learning by paying particular attention to the current operating conditions of the system since these may be most relevant to determining how to enhance performance; (ii) after learning how to control the plant for some operating condition, if the operating conditions change, then the best way to control the system may have to be relearned; and (iii) a human with a significant amount of experience at controlling the system in one operating region should not forget this experience if the operating condition changes. To mimic these types of human learning behavior, we introduce three strategies that can be used to dynamically focus a learning controller onto the current operating region of the system.

The method proposed here enables the detection of a much larger range of facial behavior by recognizing facial muscle actions [action units (AUs)] that compound expressions. AUs are agnostic, leaving the inference about conveyed intent to higher order decision making (e. g., emotion recognition). The proposed fully automatic method not only allows the recognition of 22 AUs but also explicitly models their temporal characteristics (i.e., sequences of temporal segments: neutral, onset, apex, and offset). To do so, it uses a facial point detector based on Gabor-feature-based boosted classifiers to automatically localize 20 facial fiducial points. These points are tracked through a sequence of images using a method called particle filtering with factorized likelihoods. To encode AUs and their temporal activation models based on the tracking data, it applies a combination of GentleBoost, support vector machines, and hidden Markov models. We attain an average AU recognition rate of 95.3% when tested on a benchmark set of deliberately displayed facial expressions and 72% when tested on spontaneous expressions.",,,,,,"Valstar, Michel/0000-0003-2414-161X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,FEB,2012,42,1,,,,,28,43,,10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2163710,0.0,,,,,,,,21926026.0,,,,,WOS:000302096700003,0

The robotic visual attention is mostly concerned with overt attention which accompanies head and eye movements of a robot. In this case, each movement of the camera head triggers a number of events, namely transformation of the camera and the image coordinate systems, change of content of the visual field, and partial appearance of the stimuli. All of these events contribute to the reduction in probability of meaningful identification of the next focus of attention. These events are specific to overt attention with head movement and, therefore, their effects are not addressed in the classical models of covert visual attention. This paper proposes a Bayesian model as a robot-centric solution for the overt visual attention problem.

To deal with the out-of-sample problem in visual recognition with vector input, the linear version of DLLE, i.e., linearization of DLLE (DLLE/L), is directly proposed through the graph-embedding framework. Moreover, we propose its multilinear version, i.e., tensorization of DLLE, for the out-of-sample problem with high-order tensor input. Based on DLLE, a procedure for gait recognition is described. We conduct comprehensive experiments on both gait and face recognition, and observe that: 1) DLLE along its linearization and tensorization outperforms the related versions of linear discriminant analysis, and DLLE/L demonstrates greater effectiveness than the linearization of LLE; 2) algorithms based on tensor representations are generally superior to linear algorithms when dealing with intrinsically high-order data; and 3) for human gait recognition, DLLE/L generally obtains higher accuracy than state-of-the-art gait recognition algorithms on the standard University of South Florida gait database.",,,,,"Yan, Shuicheng/HCI-1431-2022; li, xiang/GWM-6319-2022; Xu, Dong/A-3694-2011; Li, Xuelong/ABF-3381-2020; Li, Xuelong/Z-3785-2019","Xu, Dong/0000-0003-2775-9730; Li, Xuelong/0000-0002-0019-4197",,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,APR,2008,38,2,,,,,342,352,,10.1109/TSMCB.2007.911536,0.0,,,,,,,,18348919.0,,,,,WOS:000254029400007,0

In MEMS, adhesive, surface tension, friction, and van der Waals forces are dominant. Moreover, these forces are typically unknown. The proposed robust controller overcomes the unknown contact dynamics and ensures its performance in the presence of actuator constraints by assuming that the upper bounds on these forces are known. On the other hand, for the robust adaptive critic-based neural network (NN) controller, the unknown dynamic forces are estimated online. It consists of an action NN for compensating the unknown system dynamics and a critic NN for approximating a certain strategic utility function and tuning the action NN weights. By using the Lyapunov approach, the uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop manipulation error is shown for all the controllers for the pickup task. To imitate a practical system, a few system states are considered to be unavailable due to the presence of measurement noise. An output feedback version of the adaptive NN controller is proposed by exploiting the separation principle through a high-gain observer design.

In this scheme, the algorithm partitions the training patterns to groups, where all patterns within each group share the same bandwidth. Grouping relies on the analysis of the local nearest neighbor distance information around the patterns and the principal component analysis with fuzzy clustering. Furthermore, we use a hybrid optimization procedure combining a very efficient variant of the particle swarm optimizer and a quasi-Newton method for global optimization and locally optimal fine-tuning of the network bandwidths.

The algorithm works in real time and requires no prior knowledge of target or barrier movements. In the case that the barriers are stationary, this paper proves that this algorithm always results in the robot catching the target, provided it moves at a greater speed than the target, and the dynamic-system update frequency is sufficiently large. Like most robot-path-planning approaches, the environment is represented by a topologically organized map. Each grid point on the map has only local connections to its neighboring grid points from which it receives information in real time. The information stored at each point is a current estimate of the distance to the nearest target and the neighbor from which this distance was determined. Updating the distance estimate at each grid point is done using only the information gathered from the point's neighbors, that is, each point can be considered an independent processor, and the order in which grid points are updated is not determined based on global knowledge of the current distances at each point or the previous history of each point. The robot path is determined in real time completely from the information at the robot's current grid-point location. The computational effort to update each point is minimal, allowing for rapid propagation of the distance information outward along the grid from the target locations. In the static situation, where both the targets and the barriers do not move, this algorithm is a DP solution to the shortest path problem, but is restricted by lack of global knowledge. In this case, this paper proves that the dynamic system converges in a small number of iterations to a state where the minimal distance to a target is recorded at each grid point and shows that this robot-path-planning algorithm can be made to always choose an optimal path.

Since a stroke inevitably contains noises, the first stage may produce wrong or inaccurate segmentation points, resulting in the wrong substroke classification in the second stage and inaccurately fitted parameters in the third stage.

Most of the proposed methods suffer from the use of offline learning algorithms to globally optimize this multi-criteria problem. Despite the ability to reach an optimal solution in terms of accuracy and interpretability, these offline methods are not suitably applicable to learning in adaptive or incremental systems. Furthermore, most of the learning methods in TSK-model are susceptible to the limitation of the curse-of-dimensionality. This paper attempts to study the criteria in the design of TSK-models. They are: 1) the interpretability of the local model; 2) the global accuracy; and 3) the system dimensionality issues. A generic framework is proposed to handle the different scenarios in this design problem. The framework is termed the generic fuzzy input Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy framework (FITSK). The FITSK framework is extensible to both the zero-order and the first-order FITSK models. A zero-order FITSK model is suitable for the learning of adaptive system, and the bias-variance of the system can be easily controlled through the degree of localization. On the other hand, a first-order FITSK model is able to achieve higher learning accuracy for nonlinear system estimation. A localized version of recursive least-squares algorithm is proposed for the parameter tuning of the first-order FITSK model. The local recursive least-squares is able to achieve a balance between interpretability and learning accuracy of a system, and possesses greater immunity to the curse-of-dimensionality. The learning algorithms for the FITSK models are online, and are readily applicable to adaptive system with fast convergence speed. Finally, a proposed guideline is discussed to handle the model selection of different FITSK models to tackle the multi-criteria design problem of applying the TSK-model.

An interesting commercial application with a wide impact on a variety of fields, which can benefit from the computational grid technologies, is three-dimensional (3-D) rendering. In order to implement, however, 3-D rendering to a grid infrastructure, we should develop appropriate scheduling and resource allocation mechanisms so that the negotiated (QoS) requirements are met. Efficient scheduling schemes require modeling and prediction of rendering workload. In this paper workload prediction is addressed based on a combined fuzzy classification and neural network model. Initially, appropriate descriptors are extracted to represent the synthetic world. The descriptors are obtained by parsing,RIB formatted files, which provides a general structure for describing computer-generated images. Fuzzy classification is used for organizing rendering descriptor so that a reliable representation is accomplished which increases the prediction accuracy. Neural network performs workload prediction by modeling the nonlinear input-output relationship between rendering descriptors and the respective computational complexity. To increase prediction accuracy, a constructive algorithm is adopted in this paper to train the neural network so that network weights and size are simultaneously estimated. Then, a grid scheduler scheme is proposed to estimate the queuing order that the tasks should be, executed and the most appopriate processor assignment so that the demanded QoS are satisfied as much as possible.

These systems may exhibit deadlock situations occurring when a circular wait arises because each piece in a set requires a resource currently held by another job in the same set. Several authors have proposed different policies to control resource allocation in order to avoid deadlock problems. These approaches are mainly based on some formal models of manufacturing systems, such as Petri nets (PNs), directed graphs, etc. Since they describe various peculiarities of the FMS operation in a modular and systematic way, PNs are the most extensively used tool to model such systems. On the other hand, digraphs are more synthetic than PNs because their vertices are just the system resources. So, digraphs describe the interactions between jobs and resources only, while neglecting other details on the system operation. The aim of this paper is to show the tight connections between the two approaches to the deadlock problem, by proposing a unitary framework that links graph-theoretic and PN models and results, In this context, we establish a direct correspondence between the structural elements of the PN (empty siphons) and those of the digraphs (maximal-weight zero-outdegree strong components) characterizing a deadlock occurrence.

This paper presents a novel solution to the problem of early motion detection by a moving observer. The solution requires the observer to be active in the acquisition of images thereby controlling the optical Bow pattern due to egomotion. A theoretical analysis is done based on geometric considerations to establish conditions that are necessary and sufficient to guarantee motion detection at a point. The detection problem is posed in terms of locally computable image quantities (the normal image how) which this makes it implementable in real time. The performance of the technique can be improved by imposing any applicable constraint; this is demonstrated for the detection of the motions of ''compact'' objects satisfying a size bound. The goal is to design a flexible and efficient early motion detection strategy that can be tailored to the needs of a particular navigation system.,,,,,"Aloimonos, Yiannis/AAI-2969-2020","Aloimonos, Yiannis/0000-0002-8152-4281",,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,,,,,FEB,1996,26,1,,,,,42,52,,10.1109/3477.484437,0.0,,,,,,,,18263005.0,,,,,WOS:A1996UC99900004,0

Standardization and comparability have received some attention; for instance, there exist a number of commonly used facial expression databases. However, lack of a commonly accepted evaluation protocol and, typically, lack of sufficient details needed to reproduce the reported individual results make it difficult to compare systems. This, in turn, hinders the progress of the field. A periodical challenge in facial expression recognition would allow such a comparison on a level playing field. It would provide an insight on how far the field has come and would allow researchers to identify new goals, challenges, and targets. This paper presents a meta-analysis of the first such challenge in automatic recognition of facial expressions, held during the IEEE conference on Face and Gesture Recognition 2011. It details the challenge data, evaluation protocol, and the results attained in two subchallenges: AU detection and classification of facial expression imagery in terms of a number of discrete emotion categories.

These features open opportunities for users to introduce polluted content, or simply pollution, into the system. For instance, spammers may post an unrelated video as response to a popular one, aiming at increasing the likelihood of the response being viewed by a larger number of users. Moreover, content promoters may try to gain visibility to a specific video by posting a large number of (potentially unrelated) responses to boost the rank of the responded video, making it appear in the top lists maintained by the system. Content pollution may jeopardize the trust of users on the system, thus compromising its success in promoting social interactions. In spite of that, the available literature is very limited in providing a deep understanding of this problem. In this paper, we address the issue of detecting video spammers and promoters. Towards that end, we first manually build a test collection of real YouTube users, classifying them as spammers, promoters, and legitimate users. Using our test collection, we provide a characterization of content, individual, and social attributes that help distinguish each user class. We then investigate the feasibility of using supervised classification algorithms to automatically detect spammers and promoters, and assess their effectiveness in our test collection. While our classification approach succeeds at separating spammers and promoters from legitimate users, the high cost of manually labeling vast amounts of examples compromises its full potential in realistic scenarios. For this reason, we further propose an active learning approach that automatically chooses a set of examples to label, which is likely to provide the highest amount of information, drastically reducing the amount of required training data while maintaining comparable classification effectiveness.",,,,,"Veloso, Adriano/C-8695-2013; Almeida, Jussara M/AAD-4947-2022","Veloso, Adriano/0000-0002-9177-4954; Almeida, Virgilio/0000-0001-6452-0361; Goncalves, Marcos Andre/0000-0002-2075-3363",,,,,,,,,,,,,1083-4419,1941-0492,,,,JUN,2012,42,3,,,,,688,701,,10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2173799,0.0,,,,,,,,22147305.0,,,,,WOS:000304163200009,0
