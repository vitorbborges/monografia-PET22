Local Component Analysis,"['Roux, Nicolas Le', 'Bach, Francis']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," Kernel density estimation, a.k.a. Parzen windows, is a popular density estimation method, which can be used for outlier detection or clustering. With multivariate data, its performance is heavily reliant on the metric used within the kernel. Most earlier work has focused on learning only the bandwidth of the kernel (i.e., a scalar multiplicative factor). In this paper, we propose to learn a full Euclidean metric through an expectation-minimization (EM) procedure, which can be seen as an unsupervised counterpart to neighbourhood component analysis (NCA). In order to avoid overfitting with a fully nonparametric density estimator in high dimensions, we also consider a semi-parametric Gaussian-Parzen density model, where some of the variables are modelled through a jointly Gaussian density, while others are modelled through Parzen windows. For these two models, EM leads to simple closed-form updates based on matrix inversions and eigenvalue decompositions. We show empirically that our method leads to density estimators with higher test-likelihoods than natural competing methods, and that the metrics may be used within most unsupervised learning techniques that rely on such metrics, such as spectral clustering or manifold learning methods. Finally, we present a stochastic approximation scheme which allows for the use of this method in a large-scale setting. ", May 2-4, 2013
When Does a Mixture of Products Contain a Product of Mixtures?,"['Montufar, Guido F.', 'Morton, Jason']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," We derive relations between theoretical properties of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), popular machine learning models which form the building blocks of deep learning models, and several natural notions from discrete mathematics and convex geometry. We give implications and equivalences relating RBM-representable probability distributions, perfectly reconstructible inputs, Hamming modes, zonotopes and zonosets, point configurations in hyperplane arrangements, linear threshold codes, and multi-covering numbers of hypercubes. As a motivating application, we prove results on the relative representational power of mixtures of product distributions and products of mixtures of pairs of product distributions (RBMs) that formally justify widely held intuitions about distributed representations. In particular, we show that a mixture of products requiring an exponentially larger number of parameters is needed to represent the probability distributions which can be obtained as products of mixtures.

Linear-Nonlinear-Poisson Neurons Can Do Inference On Deep Boltzmann Machines,"['Shao, Louis Yuanlong']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," One conjecture in both deep learning and classical connectionist viewpoint is that the biological brain implements certain kinds of deep networks as its back-end. However, to our knowledge, a detailed correspondence has not yet been set up, which is important if we want to bridge between neuroscience and machine learning. Recent researches emphasized the biological plausibility of Linear-Nonlinear-Poisson (LNP) neuron model. We show that with neurally plausible settings, the whole network is capable of representing any Boltzmann machine and performing a semi-stochastic Bayesian inference algorithm lying between Gibbs sampling and variational inference.

Regularized Auto-Encoders Estimate Local Statistics,"['Alain, Guillaume', 'Bengio, Yoshua']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," What do auto-encoders learn about the underlying data generating distribution? Recent work suggests that some auto-encoder variants do a good job of capturing the local manifold structure of data. This paper clarifies some of these previous observations by showing that minimizing a particular form of regularized reconstruction error yields a reconstruction function that locally characterizes the shape of the data generating density. We show that the auto-encoder captures the score (derivative of the log-density with respect to the input). It contradicts previous interpretations of reconstruction error as an energy function. Unlike previous results, the theorems provided here are completely generic and do not depend on the parametrization of the auto-encoder: they show what the auto-encoder would tend to if given enough capacity and examples. These results are for a contractive training criterion we show to be similar to the denoising auto-encoder training criterion with small corruption noise, but with contraction applied on the whole reconstruction function rather than just encoder. Similarly to score matching, one can consider the proposed training criterion as a convenient alternative to maximum likelihood because it does not involve a partition function. Finally, we show how an approximate Metropolis-Hastings MCMC can be setup to recover samples from the estimated distribution, and this is confirmed in sampling experiments. ", May 2-4, 2013
Visual Objects Classification with Sliding Spatial Pyramid Matching,"['Lim, Hao Wooi', 'Tay, Yong Haur']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," We present a method for visual object classification using only a single feature, transformed color SIFT with a variant of Spatial Pyramid Matching (SPM) that we called Sliding Spatial Pyramid Matching (SSPM), trained with an ensemble of linear regression (provided by LINEAR) to obtained state of the art result on Caltech-101 of 83.46%. SSPM is a special version of SPM where instead of dividing an image into K number of regions, a subwindow of fixed size is slide around the image with a fixed step size. For each subwindow, a histogram of visual words is generated. To obtained the visual vocabulary, instead of performing K-means clustering, we randomly pick N exemplars from the training set and encode them with a soft non-linear mapping method. We then trained 15 models, each with a different visual word size with linear regression. All 15 models are then averaged together to form a single strong model. ", May 2-4, 2013
Cutting Recursive Autoencoder Trees,"['Scheible, Christian', 'Schuetze, Hinrich']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," Deep Learning models enjoy considerable success in Natural Language Processing. While deep architectures produce useful representations that lead to improvements in various tasks, they are often difficult to interpret. This makes the analysis of learned structures particularly difficult. In this paper, we rely on empirical tests to see whether a particular structure makes sense. We present an analysis of the Semi-Supervised Recursive Autoencoder, a well-known model that produces structural representations of text. We show that for certain tasks, the structure of the autoencoder can be significantly reduced without loss of classification accuracy and we evaluate the produced structures using human judgment.

Clustering Learning for Robotic Vision,"['Culurciello, Eugenio', 'Bates, Jordan', 'Dundar, Aysegul', 'Carrasco, Jose', 'Farabet, Clement']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations, We present the clustering learning technique applied to multi-layer feedforward deep neural networks. We show that this unsupervised learning technique can compute network filters with only a few minutes and a much reduced set of parameters. The goal of this paper is to promote the technique for general-purpose robotic vision systems. We report its use in static image datasets and object tracking datasets. We show that networks trained with clustering learning can outperform large networks trained for many hours on complex datasets. , May 2-4, 2013
Unsupervised Feature Learning for low-level Local Image Descriptors,"['Osendorfer, Christian', 'Bayer, Justin', 'Urban, Sebastian', 'van der Smagt, Patrick']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," Unsupervised feature learning has shown impressive results for a wide range of input modalities, in particular for object classification tasks in computer vision. Using a large amount of unlabeled data, unsupervised feature learning methods are utilized to construct high-level representations that are discriminative enough for subsequently trained supervised classification algorithms. However, it has never been \emph{quantitatively} investigated yet how well unsupervised learning methods can find \emph{low-level representations} for image patches without any additional supervision. In this paper we examine the performance of pure unsupervised methods on a low-level correspondence task, a problem that is central to many Computer Vision applications. We find that a special type of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) performs comparably to hand-crafted descriptors. Additionally, a simple binarization scheme produces compact representations that perform better than several state-of-the-art descriptors. ", May 2-4, 2013
Matrix Approximation under Local Low-Rank Assumption,"['Lee, Joonseok', 'Kim, Seungyeon', 'Lebanon, Guy', 'Singer, Yoram']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," Matrix approximation is a common tool in machine learning for building accurate prediction models for recommendation systems, text mining, and computer vision. A prevalent assumption in constructing matrix approximations is that the partially observed matrix is of low-rank. We propose a new matrix approximation model where we assume instead that the matrix is only locally of low-rank, leading to a representation of the observed matrix as a weighted sum of low-rank matrices. We analyze the accuracy of the proposed local low-rank modeling. Our experiments show improvements in prediction accuracy in recommendation tasks. ", May 2-4, 2013
The Manifold of Human Emotions,"['Kim, Seungyeon', 'Li, Fuxin', 'Lebanon, Guy', 'Essa, Irfan']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," Sentiment analysis predicts the presence of positive or negative emotions in a text document. In this paper, we consider higher dimensional extensions of the sentiment concept, which represent a richer set of human emotions. Our approach goes beyond previous work in that our model contains a continuous manifold rather than a finite set of human emotions. We investigate the resulting model, compare it to psychological observations, and explore its predictive capabilities. ", May 2-4, 2013
Efficient Learning of Domain-invariant Image Representations,"['Hoffman, Judy', 'Rodner, Erik', 'Donahue, Jeff', 'Darrell, Trevor', 'Saenko, Kate']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," We present an algorithm that learns representations which explicitly compensate for domain mismatch and which can be efficiently realized as linear classifiers. Specifically, we form a linear transformation that maps features from the target (test) domain to the source (training) domain as part of training the classifier. We optimize both the transformation and classifier parameters jointly, and introduce an efficient cost function based on misclassification loss. Our method combines several features previously unavailable in a single algorithm: multi-class adaptation through representation learning, ability to map across heterogeneous feature spaces, and scalability to large datasets. We present experiments on several image datasets that demonstrate improved accuracy and computational advantages compared to previous approaches. ", May 2-4, 2013
Auto-pooling: Learning to Improve Invariance of Image Features from Image Sequences,"['Sukhbaatar, Sainbayar', 'Makino, Takaki', 'Aihara, Kazuyuki']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," Learning invariant representations from images is one of the hardest challenges facing computer vision. Spatial pooling is widely used to create invariance to spatial shifting, but it is restricted to convolutional models. In this paper, we propose a novel pooling method that can learn soft clustering of features from image sequences. It is trained to improve the temporal coherence of features, while keeping the information loss at minimum. Our method does not use spatial information, so it can be used with non-convolutional models too. Experiments on images extracted from natural videos showed that our method can cluster similar features together. When trained by convolutional features, auto-pooling outperformed traditional spatial pooling on an image classification task, even though it does not use the spatial topology of features.

Barnes-Hut-SNE,"['van der Maaten, Laurens']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," The paper presents an O(N log N)-implementation of t-SNE -- an embedding technique that is commonly used for the visualization of high-dimensional data in scatter plots and that normally runs in O(N^2). The new implementation uses vantage-point trees to compute sparse pairwise similarities between the input data objects, and it uses a variant of the Barnes-Hut algorithm - an algorithm used by astronomers to perform N-body simulations - to approximate the forces between the corresponding points in the embedding. Our experiments show that the new algorithm, called Barnes-Hut-SNE, leads to substantial computational advantages over standard t-SNE, and that it makes it possible to learn embeddings of data sets with millions of objects.

The Diagonalized Newton Algorithm for Nonnegative Matrix Factorization,"['Van hamme, Hugo']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has become a popular machine learning approach to many problems in text mining, speech and image processing, bio-informatics and seismic data analysis to name a few. In NMF, a matrix of non-negative data is approximated by the low-rank product of two matrices with non-negative entries. In this paper, the approximation quality is measured by the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the data and its low-rank reconstruction. The existence of the simple multiplicative update (MU) algorithm for computing the matrix factors has contributed to the success of NMF. Despite the availability of algorithms showing faster convergence, MU remains popular due to its simplicity. In this paper, a diagonalized Newton algorithm (DNA) is proposed showing faster convergence while the implementation remains simple and suitable for high-rank problems. The DNA algorithm is applied to various publicly available data sets, showing a substantial speed-up on modern hardware. ", May 2-4, 2013
Feature grouping from spatially constrained multiplicative interaction,"['Bauer, Felix', 'Memisevic, Roland']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," We present a feature learning model that learns to encode relationships between images. The model is defined as a Gated Boltzmann Machine, which is constrained such that hidden units that are nearby in space can gate each other's connections. We show how frequency/orientation ""columns"" as well as topographic filter maps follow naturally from training the model on image pairs. The model also helps explain why square-pooling models yield feature groups with similar grouping properties. Experimental results on synthetic image transformations show that spatially constrained gating is an effective way to reduce the number of parameters and thereby to regularize a transformation-learning model.

Factorized Topic Models,"['Zhang, Cheng', 'Ek, Carl Henrik', 'Damianou, Andreas', 'Kjellstrom, Hedvig']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," In this paper we present a modification to a latent topic model, which makes the model exploit supervision to produce a factorized representation of the observed data. The structured parameterization separately encodes variance that is shared between classes from variance that is private to each class by the introduction of a new prior over the topic space. The approach allows for a more eff{}icient inference and provides an intuitive interpretation of the data in terms of an informative signal together with structured noise. The factorized representation is shown to enhance inference performance for image, text, and video classification. ", May 2-4, 2013
Boltzmann Machines and Denoising Autoencoders for Image Denoising,"['Cho, Kyunghyun']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," Image denoising based on a probabilistic model of local image patches has been employed by various researchers, and recently a deep (denoising) autoencoder has been proposed by Burger et al. [2012] and Xie et al. [2012] as a good model for this. In this paper, we propose that another popular family of models in the field of deep learning, called Boltzmann machines, can perform image denoising as well as, or in certain cases of high level of noise, better than denoising autoencoders. We empirically evaluate the two models on three different sets of images with different types and levels of noise. Throughout the experiments we also examine the effect of the depth of the models. The experiments confirmed our claim and revealed that the performance can be improved by adding more hidden layers, especially when the level of noise is high. ", May 2-4, 2013
Pushing Stochastic Gradient towards Second-Order Methods -- Backpropagation Learning with Transformations in Nonlinearities,"['Vatanen, Tommi', 'Raiko, Tapani', 'Valpola, Harri', 'LeCun, Yann']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," Recently, we proposed to transform the outputs of each hidden neuron in a multi-layer perceptron network to have zero output and zero slope on average, and use separate shortcut connections to model the linear dependencies instead. We continue the work by firstly introducing a third transformation to normalize the scale of the outputs of each hidden neuron, and secondly by analyzing the connections to second order optimization methods. We show that the transformations make a simple stochastic gradient behave closer to second-order optimization methods and thus speed up learning. This is shown both in theory and with experiments. The experiments on the third transformation show that while it further increases the speed of learning, it can also hurt performance by converging to a worse local optimum, where both the inputs and outputs of many hidden neurons are close to zero.

A Semantic Matching Energy Function for Learning with Multi-relational Data,"['Glorot, Xavier', 'Bordes, Antoine', 'Weston, Jason', 'Bengio, Yoshua']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," Large-scale relational learning becomes crucial for handling the huge amounts of structured data generated daily in many application domains ranging from computational biology or information retrieval, to natural language processing. In this paper, we present a new neural network architecture designed to embed multi-relational graphs into a flexible continuous vector space in which the original data is kept and enhanced. The network is trained to encode the semantics of these graphs in order to assign high probabilities to plausible components. We empirically show that it reaches competitive performance in link prediction on standard datasets from the literature. ", May 2-4, 2013
Learnable Pooling Regions for Image Classification,"['Malinowski, Mateusz', 'Fritz, Mario']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," Biologically inspired, from the early HMAX model to Spatial Pyramid Matching, pooling has played an important role in visual recognition pipelines. Spatial pooling, by grouping of local codes, equips these methods with a certain degree of robustness to translation and deformation yet preserving important spatial information. Despite the predominance of this approach in current recognition systems, we have seen little progress to fully adapt the pooling strategy to the task at hand. This paper proposes a model for learning task dependent pooling scheme -- including previously proposed hand-crafted pooling schemes as a particular instantiation. In our work, we investigate the role of different regularization terms showing that the smooth regularization term is crucial to achieve strong performance using the presented architecture. Finally, we propose an efficient and parallel method to train the model. Our experiments show improved performance over hand-crafted pooling schemes on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets -- in particular improving the state-of-the-art to 56.29% on the latter.

Block Coordinate Descent for Sparse NMF,"['Potluru, Vamsi K.', 'Plis, Sergey M.', 'Roux, Jonathan Le', 'Pearlmutter, Barak A.', 'Calhoun, Vince D.', 'Hayes, Thomas P.']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has become a ubiquitous tool for data analysis. An important variant is the sparse NMF problem which arises when we explicitly require the learnt features to be sparse. A natural measure of sparsity is the L$_0$ norm, however its optimization is NP-hard. Mixed norms, such as L$_1$/L$_2$ measure, have been shown to model sparsity robustly, based on intuitive attributes that such measures need to satisfy. This is in contrast to computationally cheaper alternatives such as the plain L$_1$ norm. However, present algorithms designed for optimizing the mixed norm L$_1$/L$_2$ are slow and other formulations for sparse NMF have been proposed such as those based on L$_1$ and L$_0$ norms. Our proposed algorithm allows us to solve the mixed norm sparsity constraints while not sacrificing computation time. We present experimental evidence on real-world datasets that shows our new algorithm performs an order of magnitude faster compared to the current state-of-the-art solvers optimizing the mixed norm and is suitable for large-scale datasets.

Discrete Restricted Boltzmann Machines,"['Montufar, Guido', 'Morton, Jason']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," We describe discrete restricted Boltzmann machines: probabilistic graphical models with bipartite interactions between visible and hidden discrete variables. Examples are binary restricted Boltzmann machines and discrete naive Bayes models. We detail the inference functions and distributed representations arising in these models in terms of configurations of projected products of simplices and normal fans of products of simplices. We bound the number of hidden variables, depending on the cardinalities of their state spaces, for which these models can approximate any probability distribution on their visible states to any given accuracy. In addition, we use algebraic methods and coding theory to compute their dimension. ", May 2-4, 2013
The Neural Representation Benchmark and its Evaluation on Brain and Machine,"['Cadieu, Charles F.', 'Hong, Ha', 'Yamins, Dan', 'Pinto, Nicolas', 'Majaj, Najib J.', 'DiCarlo, James J.']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," A key requirement for the development of effective learning representations is their evaluation and comparison to representations we know to be effective. In natural sensory domains, the community has viewed the brain as a source of inspiration and as an implicit benchmark for success. However, it has not been possible to directly test representational learning algorithms directly against the representations contained in neural systems. Here, we propose a new benchmark for visual representations on which we have directly tested the neural representation in multiple visual cortical areas in macaque (utilizing data from [Majaj et al., 2012]), and on which any computer vision algorithm that produces a feature space can be tested. The benchmark measures the effectiveness of the neural or machine representation by computing the classification loss on the ordered eigendecomposition of a kernel matrix [Montavon et al., 2011]. In our analysis we find that the neural representation in visual area IT is superior to visual area V4. In our analysis of representational learning algorithms, we find that three-layer models approach the representational performance of V4 and the algorithm in [Le et al., 2012] surpasses the performance of V4. Impressively, we find that a recent supervised algorithm [Krizhevsky et al., 2012] achieves performance comparable to that of IT for an intermediate level of image variation difficulty, and surpasses IT at a higher difficulty level. We believe this result represents a major milestone: it is the first learning algorithm we have found that exceeds our current estimate of IT representation performance. We hope that this benchmark will assist the community in matching the representational performance of visual cortex and will serve as an initial rallying point for further correspondence between representations derived in brains and machines.

Learning Stable Group Invariant Representations with Convolutional Networks,"['Bruna, Joan', 'Szlam, Arthur', 'LeCun, Yann']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," Transformation groups, such as translations or rotations, effectively express part of the variability observed in many recognition problems. The group structure enables the construction of invariant signal representations with appealing mathematical properties, where convolutions, together with pooling operators, bring stability to additive and geometric perturbations of the input. Whereas physical transformation groups are ubiquitous in image and audio applications, they do not account for all the variability of complex signal classes. We show that the invariance properties built by deep convolutional networks can be cast as a form of stable group invariance. The network wiring architecture determines the invariance group, while the trainable filter coefficients characterize the group action. We give explanatory examples which illustrate how the network architecture controls the resulting invariance group. We also explore the principle by which additional convolutional layers induce a group factorization enabling more abstract, powerful invariant representations. ", May 2-4, 2013
Learning Features with Structure-Adapting Multi-view Exponential Family Harmoniums,"['Kang, Yoonseop', 'Choi, Seungjin']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," We proposea graphical model for multi-view feature extraction that automatically adapts its structure to achieve better representation of data distribution. The proposed model, structure-adapting multi-view harmonium (SA-MVH) has switch parameters that control the connection between hidden nodes and input views, and learn the switch parameter while training. Numerical experiments on synthetic and a real-world dataset demonstrate the useful behavior of the SA-MVH, compared to existing multi-view feature extraction methods. ", May 2-4, 2013
Deep Predictive Coding Networks,"['Chalasani, Rakesh', 'Principe, Jose C.']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," The quality of data representation in deep learning methods is directly related to the prior model imposed on the representations; however, generally used fixed priors are not capable of adjusting to the context in the data. To address this issue, we propose deep predictive coding networks, a hierarchical generative model that empirically alters priors on the latent representations in a dynamic and context-sensitive manner. This model captures the temporal dependencies in time-varying signals and uses top-down information to modulate the representation in lower layers. The centerpiece of our model is a novel procedure to infer sparse states of a dynamic model which is used for feature extraction. We also extend this feature extraction block to introduce a pooling function that captures locally invariant representations. When applied on a natural video data, we show that our method is able to learn high-level visual features. We also demonstrate the role of the top-down connections by showing the robustness of the proposed model to structured noise. ", May 2-4, 2013
Metric-Free Natural Gradient for Joint-Training of Boltzmann Machines,"['Desjardins, Guillaume', 'Pascanu, Razvan', 'Courville, Aaron', 'Bengio, Yoshua']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," This paper introduces the Metric-Free Natural Gradient (MFNG) algorithm for training Boltzmann Machines. Similar in spirit to the Hessian-Free method of Martens [8], our algorithm belongs to the family of truncated Newton methods and exploits an efficient matrix-vector product to avoid explicitely storing the natural gradient metric $L$. This metric is shown to be the expected second derivative of the log-partition function (under the model distribution), or equivalently, the variance of the vector of partial derivatives of the energy function. We evaluate our method on the task of joint-training a 3-layer Deep Boltzmann Machine and show that MFNG does indeed have faster per-epoch convergence compared to Stochastic Maximum Likelihood with centering, though wall-clock performance is currently not competitive.

Information Theoretic Learning with Infinitely Divisible Kernels,"['Giraldo, Luis G. Sanchez', 'Principe, Jose C.']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," In this paper, we develop a framework for information theoretic learning based on infinitely divisible matrices. We formulate an entropy-like functional on positive definite matrices based on Renyi's axiomatic definition of entropy and examine some key properties of this functional that lead to the concept of infinite divisibility. The proposed formulation avoids the plug in estimation of density and brings along the representation power of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. As an application example, we derive a supervised metric learning algorithm using a matrix based analogue to conditional entropy achieving results comparable with the state of the art.

Stochastic Pooling for Regularization of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,"['Zeiler, Matthew D.', 'Fergus, Rob']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," We introduce a simple and effective method for regularizing large convolutional neural networks. We replace the conventional deterministic pooling operations with a stochastic procedure, randomly picking the activation within each pooling region according to a multinomial distribution, given by the activities within the pooling region. The approach is hyper-parameter free and can be combined with other regularization approaches, such as dropout and data augmentation. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on four image datasets, relative to other approaches that do not utilize data augmentation. ", May 2-4, 2013
Complexity of Representation and Inference in Compositional Models with Part Sharing,"['Yuille, Alan L.', 'Mottaghi, Roozbeh']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," This paper describes serial and parallel compositional models of multiple objects with part sharing. Objects are built by part-subpart compositions and expressed in terms of a hierarchical dictionary of object parts. These parts are represented on lattices of decreasing sizes which yield an executive summary description. We describe inference and learning algorithms for these models. We analyze the complexity of this model in terms of computation time (for serial computers) and numbers of nodes (e.g., ""neurons"") for parallel computers. In particular, we compute the complexity gains by part sharing and its dependence on how the dictionary scales with the level of the hierarchy. We explore three regimes of scaling behavior where the dictionary size (i) increases exponentially with the level, (ii) is determined by an unsupervised compositional learning algorithm applied to real data, (iii) decreases exponentially with scale. This analysis shows that in some regimes the use of shared parts enables algorithms which can perform inference in time linear in the number of levels for an exponential number of objects. In other regimes part sharing has little advantage for serial computers but can give linear processing on parallel computers. ", May 2-4, 2013
Joint Training Deep Boltzmann Machines for Classification,"['Goodfellow, Ian J.', 'Courville, Aaron', 'Bengio, Yoshua']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," We introduce a new method for training deep Boltzmann machines jointly. Prior methods of training DBMs require an initial learning pass that trains the model greedily, one layer at a time, or do not perform well on classification tasks. In our approach, we train all layers of the DBM simultaneously, using a novel training procedure called multi-prediction training. The resulting model can either be interpreted as a single generative model trained to maximize a variational approximation to the generalized pseudolikelihood, or as a family of recurrent networks that share parameters and may be approximately averaged together using a novel technique we call the multi-inference trick. We show that our approach performs competitively for classification and outperforms previous methods in terms of accuracy of approximate inference and classification with missing inputs.

A Nested HDP for Hierarchical Topic Models,"['Paisley, John', 'Wang, Chong', 'Blei, David', 'Jordan, Michael I.']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," We develop a nested hierarchical Dirichlet process (nHDP) for hierarchical topic modeling. The nHDP is a generalization of the nested Chinese restaurant process (nCRP) that allows each word to follow its own path to a topic node according to a document-specific distribution on a shared tree. This alleviates the rigid, single-path formulation of the nCRP, allowing a document to more easily express thematic borrowings as a random effect.

Saturating Auto-Encoder,"['Goroshin, Rostislav', 'LeCun, Yann']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," We introduce a simple new regularizer for auto-encoders whose hidden-unit activation functions contain at least one zero-gradient (saturated) region. This regularizer explicitly encourages activations in the saturated region(s) of the corresponding activation function. We call these Saturating Auto-Encoders (SATAE). We show that the saturation regularizer explicitly limits the SATAE's ability to reconstruct inputs which are not near the data manifold. Furthermore, we show that a wide variety of features can be learned when different activation functions are used. Finally, connections are established with the Contractive and Sparse Auto-Encoders.

Big Neural Networks Waste Capacity,"['Dauphin, Yann N.', 'Bengio, Yoshua']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," This article exposes the failure of some big neural networks to leverage added capacity to reduce underfitting. Past research suggest diminishing returns when increasing the size of neural networks. Our experiments on ImageNet LSVRC-2010 show that this may be due to the fact there are highly diminishing returns for capacity in terms of training error, leading to underfitting. This suggests that the optimization method - first order gradient descent - fails at this regime. Directly attacking this problem, either through the optimization method or the choices of parametrization, may allow to improve the generalization error on large datasets, for which a large capacity is required.

Natural Gradient Revisited,"['Pascanu, Razvan', 'Bengio, Yoshua']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," The aim of this paper is three-fold. First we show that Hessian-Free (Martens, 2010) and Krylov Subspace Descent (Vinyals and Povey, 2012) can be described as implementations of natural gradient descent due to their use of the extended Gauss-Newton approximation of the Hessian. Secondly we re-derive natural gradient from basic principles, contrasting the difference between two versions of the algorithm found in the neural network literature, as well as highlighting a few differences between natural gradient and typical second order methods. Lastly we show empirically that natural gradient can be robust to overfitting and particularly it can be robust to the order in which the training data is presented to the model. ", May 2-4, 2013

Deep Learning for Detecting Robotic Grasps,"['Lenz, Ian', 'Lee, Honglak', 'Saxena, Ashutosh']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," We consider the problem of detecting robotic grasps in an RGB-D view of a scene containing objects. In this work, we apply a deep learning approach to solve this problem, which avoids time-consuming hand-design of features. This presents two main challenges. First, we need to evaluate a huge number of candidate grasps. In order to make detection fast, as well as robust, we present a two-step cascaded structure with two deep networks, where the top detections from the first are re-evaluated by the second. The first network has fewer features, is faster to run, and can effectively prune out unlikely candidate grasps. The second, with more features, is slower but has to run only on the top few detections. Second, we need to handle multimodal inputs well, for which we present a method to apply structured regularization on the weights based on multimodal group regularization. We demonstrate that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods in robotic grasp detection, and can be used to successfully execute grasps on two different robotic platforms.

Feature Learning in Deep Neural Networks - A Study on Speech Recognition Tasks,"['Yu, Dong', 'Seltzer, Michael L.', 'Li, Jinyu', 'Huang, Jui-Ting', 'Seide, Frank']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks (DNNs) perform significantly better than shallow networks and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) on large vocabulary speech recognition tasks. In this paper, we argue that the improved accuracy achieved by the DNNs is the result of their ability to extract discriminative internal representations that are robust to the many sources of variability in speech signals. We show that these representations become increasingly insensitive to small perturbations in the input with increasing network depth, which leads to better speech recognition performance with deeper networks. We also show that DNNs cannot extrapolate to test samples that are substantially different from the training examples. If the training data are sufficiently representative, however, internal features learned by the DNN are relatively stable with respect to speaker differences, bandwidth differences, and environment distortion. This enables DNN-based recognizers to perform as well or better than state-of-the-art systems based on GMMs or shallow networks without the need for explicit model adaptation or feature normalization.

Jitter-Adaptive Dictionary Learning - Application to Multi-Trial Neuroelectric Signals,"['Hitziger, Sebastian', 'Clerc, Maureen', 'Gramfort, Alexandre', 'Saillet, Sandrine', 'Bénar, Christian', 'Papadopoulo, Théodore']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," Dictionary Learning has proven to be a powerful tool for many image processing tasks, where atoms are typically defined on small image patches. As a drawback, the dictionary only encodes basic structures. In addition, this approach treats patches of different locations in one single set, which means a loss of information when features are well-aligned across signals. This is the case, for instance, in multi-trial magneto- or electroencephalography (M/EEG). Learning the dictionary on the entire signals could make use of the alignement and reveal higher-level features. In this case, however, small missalignements or phase variations of features would not be compensated for. In this paper, we propose an extension to the common dictionary learning framework to overcome these limitations by allowing atoms to adapt their position across signals. The method is validated on simulated and real neuroelectric data. ", May 2-4, 2013
Learning New Facts From Knowledge Bases With Neural Tensor Networks and Semantic Word Vectors,"['Chen, Danqi', 'Socher, Richard', 'Manning, Christopher D.', 'Ng, Andrew Y.']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," Knowledge bases provide applications with the benefit of easily accessible, systematic relational knowledge but often suffer in practice from their incompleteness and lack of knowledge of new entities and relations. Much work has focused on building or extending them by finding patterns in large unannotated text corpora. In contrast, here we mainly aim to complete a knowledge base by predicting additional true relationships between entities, based on generalizations that can be discerned in the given knowledgebase. We introduce a neural tensor network (NTN) model which predicts new relationship entries that can be added to the database. This model can be improved by initializing entity representations with word vectors learned in an unsupervised fashion from text, and when doing this, existing relations can even be queried for entities that were not present in the database. Our model generalizes and outperforms existing models for this problem, and can classify unseen relationships in WordNet with an accuracy of 75.8%. ", May 2-4, 2013
Two SVDs produce more focal deep learning representations,"['Schuetze, Hinrich', 'Scheible, Christian']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," A key characteristic of work on deep learning and neural networks in general is that it relies on representations of the input that support generalization, robust inference, domain adaptation and other desirable functionalities. Much recent progress in the field has focused on efficient and effective methods for computing representations. In this paper, we propose an alternative method that is more efficient than prior work and produces representations that have a property we call focality -- a property we hypothesize to be important for neural network representations. The method consists of a simple application of two consecutive SVDs and is inspired by Anandkumar (2012). ", May 2-4, 2013
Training Neural Networks with Stochastic Hessian-Free Optimization,"['Kiros, Ryan']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," Hessian-free (HF) optimization has been successfully used for training deep autoencoders and recurrent networks. HF uses the conjugate gradient algorithm to construct update directions through curvature-vector products that can be computed on the same order of time as gradients. In this paper we exploit this property and study stochastic HF with gradient and curvature mini-batches independent of the dataset size. We modify Martens' HF for these settings and integrate dropout, a method for preventing co-adaptation of feature detectors, to guard against overfitting. Stochastic Hessian-free optimization gives an intermediary between SGD and HF that achieves competitive performance on both classification and deep autoencoder experiments. ", May 2-4, 2013
Regularized Discriminant Embedding for Visual Descriptor Learning,"['Kim, Kye-Hyeon', 'Cai, Rui', 'Zhang, Lei', 'Choi, Seungjin']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," Images can vary according to changes in viewpoint, resolution, noise, and illumination. In this paper, we aim to learn representations for an image, which are robust to wide changes in such environmental conditions, using training pairs of matching and non-matching local image patches that are collected under various environmental conditions. We present a regularized discriminant analysis that emphasizes two challenging categories among the given training pairs: (1) matching, but far apart pairs and (2) non-matching, but close pairs in the original feature space (e.g., SIFT feature space). Compared to existing work on metric learning and discriminant analysis, our method can better distinguish relevant images from irrelevant, but look-alike images. ", May 2-4, 2013
Zero-Shot Learning Through Cross-Modal Transfer,"['Socher, Richard', 'Ganjoo, Milind', 'Sridhar, Hamsa', 'Bastani, Osbert', 'Manning, Christopher D.', 'Ng, Andrew Y.']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," This work introduces a model that can recognize objects in images even if no training data is available for the objects. The only necessary knowledge about the unseen categories comes from unsupervised large text corpora. In our zero-shot framework distributional information in language can be seen as spanning a semantic basis for understanding what objects look like. Most previous zero-shot learning models can only differentiate between unseen classes. In contrast, our model can both obtain state of the art performance on classes that have thousands of training images and obtain reasonable performance on unseen classes. This is achieved by first using outlier detection in the semantic space and then two separate recognition models. Furthermore, our model does not require any manually defined semantic features for either words or images. ", May 2-4, 2013
Gradient Driven Learning for Pooling in Visual Pipeline Feature Extraction Models,"['Rose, Derek', 'Arel, Itamar']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," Hyper-parameter selection remains a daunting task when building a pattern recognition architecture which performs well, particularly in recently constructed visual pipeline models for feature extraction. We re-formulate pooling in an existing pipeline as a function of adjustable pooling map weight parameters and propose the use of supervised error signals from gradient descent to tune the established maps within the model. This technique allows us to learn what would otherwise be a design choice within the model and specialize the maps to aggregate areas of invariance for the task presented. Preliminary results show moderate potential gains in classification accuracy and highlight areas of importance within the intermediate feature representation space. ", May 2-4, 2013
"Adaptive learning rates and parallelization for stochastic, sparse, non-smooth gradients","['Schaul, Tom', 'LeCun, Yann']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," Recent work has established an empirically successful framework for adapting learning rates for stochastic gradient descent (SGD). This effectively removes all needs for tuning, while automatically reducing learning rates over time on stationary problems, and permitting learning rates to grow appropriately in non-stationary tasks. Here, we extend the idea in three directions, addressing proper minibatch parallelization, including reweighted updates for sparse or orthogonal gradients, improving robustness on non-smooth loss functions, in the process replacing the diagonal Hessian estimation procedure that may not always be available by a robust finite-difference approximation. The final algorithm integrates all these components, has linear complexity and is hyper-parameter free. ", May 2-4, 2013
Discriminative Recurrent Sparse Auto-Encoders,"['Rolfe, Jason Tyler', 'LeCun, Yann']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," We present the discriminative recurrent sparse auto-encoder model, comprising a recurrent encoder of rectified linear units, unrolled for a fixed number of iterations, and connected to two linear decoders that reconstruct the input and predict its supervised classification. Training via backpropagation-through-time initially minimizes an unsupervised sparse reconstruction error; the loss function is then augmented with a discriminative term on the supervised classification. The depth implicit in the temporally-unrolled form allows the system to exhibit all the power of deep networks, while substantially reducing the number of trainable parameters. From an initially unstructured network the hidden units differentiate into categorical-units, each of which represents an input prototype with a well-defined class; and part-units representing deformations of these prototypes. The learned organization of the recurrent encoder is hierarchical: part-units are driven directly by the input, whereas the activity of categorical-units builds up over time through interactions with the part-units. Even using a small number of hidden units per layer, discriminative recurrent sparse auto-encoders achieve excellent performance on MNIST. ", May 2-4, 2013
Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space,"['Mikolov, Tomas', 'Chen, Kai', 'Corrado, Greg', 'Dean, Jeffrey']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," We propose two novel model architectures for computing continuous vector representations of words from very large data sets. The quality of these representations is measured in a word similarity task, and the results are compared to the previously best performing techniques based on different types of neural networks. We observe large improvements in accuracy at much lower computational cost, i.e. it takes less than a day to learn high quality word vectors from a 1.6 billion words data set. Furthermore, we show that these vectors provide state-of-the-art performance on our test set for measuring syntactic and semantic word similarities. ", May 2-4, 2013
Knowledge Matters: Importance of Prior Information for Optimization,"['Gülçehre, Çağlar', 'Bengio, Yoshua']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," We explore the effect of introducing prior information into the intermediate level of neural networks for a learning task on which all the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms tested failed to learn. We motivate our work from the hypothesis that humans learn such intermediate concepts from other individuals via a form of supervision or guidance using a curriculum. The experiments we have conducted provide positive evidence in favor of this hypothesis. In our experiments, a two-tiered MLP architecture is trained on a dataset with 64x64 binary inputs images, each image with three sprites. The final task is to decide whether all the sprites are the same or one of them is different. Sprites are pentomino tetris shapes and they are placed in an image with different locations using scaling and rotation transformations. The first part of the two-tiered MLP is pre-trained with intermediate-level targets being the presence of sprites at each location, while the second part takes the output of the first part as input and predicts the final task's target binary event. The two-tiered MLP architecture, with a few tens of thousand examples, was able to learn the task perfectly, whereas all other algorithms (include unsupervised pre-training, but also traditional algorithms like SVMs, decision trees and boosting) all perform no better than chance. We hypothesize that the optimization difficulty involved when the intermediate pre-training is not performed is due to the {\em composition} of two highly non-linear tasks. Our findings are also consistent with hypotheses on cultural learning inspired by the observations of optimization problems with deep learning, presumably because of effective local minima.

Herded Gibbs Sampling,"['Bornn, Luke', 'Chen, Yutian', 'de Freitas, Nando', 'Eskelin, Mareija', 'Fang, Jing', 'Welling, Max']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," The Gibbs sampler is one of the most popular algorithms for inference in statistical models. In this paper, we introduce a herding variant of this algorithm, called herded Gibbs, that is entirely deterministic. We prove that herded Gibbs has an $O(1/T)$ convergence rate for models with independent variables and for fully connected probabilistic graphical models. Herded Gibbs is shown to outperform Gibbs in the tasks of image denoising with MRFs and named entity recognition with CRFs. However, the convergence for herded Gibbs for sparsely connected probabilistic graphical models is still an open problem. ", May 2-4, 2013
Affinity Weighted Embedding,"['Weston, Jason', 'Weiss, Ron', 'Yee, Hector']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," Supervised (linear) embedding models like Wsabie and PSI have proven successful at ranking, recommendation and annotation tasks. However, despite being scalable to large datasets they do not take full advantage of the extra data due to their linear nature, and typically underfit. We propose a new class of models which aim to provide improved performance while retaining many of the benefits of the existing class of embedding models. Our new approach works by iteratively learning a linear embedding model where the next iteration's features and labels are reweighted as a function of the previous iteration. We describe several variants of the family, and give some initial results. ", May 2-4, 2013
Latent Relation Representations for Universal Schemas,"['Riedel, Sebastian', 'Yao, Limin', 'McCallum, Andrew']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," Traditional relation extraction predicts relations within some fixed and finite target schema. Machine learning approaches to this task require either manual annotation or, in the case of distant supervision, existing structured sources of the same schema. The need for existing datasets can be avoided by using a universal schema: the union of all involved schemas (surface form predicates as in OpenIE, and relations in the schemas of pre-existing databases). This schema has an almost unlimited set of relations (due to surface forms), and supports integration with existing structured data (through the relation types of existing databases). To populate a database of such schema we present a family of matrix factorization models that predict affinity between database tuples and relations. We show that this achieves substantially higher accuracy than the traditional classification approach. More importantly, by operating simultaneously on relations observed in text and in pre-existing structured DBs such as Freebase, we are able to reason about unstructured and structured data in mutually-supporting ways. By doing so our approach outperforms state-of-the-art distant supervision systems. ", May 2-4, 2013
Why Size Matters: Feature Coding as Nystrom Sampling,"['Vinyals, Oriol', 'Jia, Yangqing', 'Darrell, Trevor']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," Recently, the computer vision and machine learning community has been in favor of feature extraction pipelines that rely on a coding step followed by a linear classifier, due to their overall simplicity, well understood properties of linear classifiers, and their computational efficiency. In this paper we propose a novel view of this pipeline based on kernel methods and Nystrom sampling. In particular, we focus on the coding of a data point with a local representation based on a dictionary with fewer elements than the number of data points, and view it as an approximation to the actual function that would compute pair-wise similarity to all data points (often too many to compute in practice), followed by a Nystrom sampling step to select a subset of all data points. Furthermore, since bounds are known on the approximation power of Nystrom sampling as a function of how many samples (i.e. dictionary size) we consider, we can derive bounds on the approximation of the exact (but expensive to compute) kernel matrix, and use it as a proxy to predict accuracy as a function of the dictionary size, which has been observed to increase but also to saturate as we increase its size. This model may help explaining the positive effect of the codebook size and justifying the need to stack more layers (often referred to as deep learning), as flat models empirically saturate as we add more complexity.

Hierarchical Data Representation Model - Multi-layer NMF,"['Song, Hyun Ah', 'Lee, Soo-Young']",1st International Conference on Learning Representations," In this paper, we propose a data representation model that demonstrates hierarchical feature learning using nsNMF.

We also prove that proposed method results in much better classification and reconstruction performance, especially for small number of features. feature hierarchies. ", May 2-4, 2013
